                                          NMRAnet Goals and Measures

   This document discusses how the OpenLCBTM/S9.6 proposal for the NMRAnetTM layout control bus meets the
   published Goals and Measures of the NMRA's NMRAnet effort1. The proposal for NMRAnet S9.6 has been
   developed by the OpenLCBTM group via their web site at http://openlcb.org/ and discussion group at
   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenLCB. References here to "NMRAnet" refer to this proposal. Further
   details of NMRAnet are available in other Standards and Recommended Practice documents in the S9.6
   group.

                                               Interoperability

   Goal: Products from one company can work with products from any other company, and with legacy systems.

   Measure: Manufacturers can easily test their nodes for interoperability using standard tests. Any device
   passing these tests should be able to work with other devices passing these tests. Likewise, it should
   be easy for manufacturers to build bridges to systems like DCC or Loconet which allows NMRAnet turnouts
   to be controlled from DCC throttles, and DCC engines/accessories to be controlled from NMRAnet.

Reply

   The S9.6 protocols are being documented at a high level, such that any proper implementation will
   interoperate with any other. At the same time, proper functioning of low-level detail is being insured
   via test and example implementations.

   Care is being taken to define a protocol that can be used by large and small manufacturers without
   giving anybody an undue advantage. For example, the test and example implementations are available for
   manufacturers to study and, subject to licensing, use as the basis for their own products.

   Non-normative examples of connections to DCC, LocoNet, and eventually other systems, such as C/MRI,
   Xpressnet, S88, and NCE Cab Bus, are being created to demonstrate interoperability.

Features

    1. S9.6 nodes have world-wide unique node IDs, and therefore there is no risk of clashes between
       products from different companies.

    2. The S9.6 generous 48-bit node ID allows legacy IDs to be encapsulated when bridged onto S9.6.

Issues

   S9.6 has not yet specified any specific conformance testing criteria or methodology. We are developing
   an extensive series of tests for development purposes, which may in the future form the basis of
   conformance tests, but the process for doing that has not been specified by the NMRA, as yet.

    

    

                                              No Central Control

   Goal: Products can interact with other products without the need for a central processor.

   Measure: Once a layout is set up, it should run perfectly and completely without a central processing
   system for basic and advanced functionality.

Features

   The S9.6 protocols provide both direct node-to-node communications (datagrams, streams), and broadcast
   notifications (events). No central facility is required for any of these.

    1. S9.6 does not mandate the existence of either a Network Manager nor Configuration Manager, although
       these can be used if desired.

    2. On CAN, S9.6 node ID aliases are negotiated between the nodes present, and no central facility is
       required for this.

Issues

                                             Optional PC Control

   Goal: A PC can provide higher-level functionality, such as a CTC Interlocking, and system functions such
   as monitoring, testing, and debugging.

   Measure: A computer attached to the bus can provide more advanced functionality, such as CTC, and
   system-control functions such as: monitoring, testing and debugging

Features

     * S9.6 allows multiple connections for multiple computers.

     * S9.6 allows multiple Network Managers, Configuration, and other programs to be present and
       operational at the same time, which will be important for large layouts, such as museums and large
       modular meets. These can come and go as needed to do their job; they do not need to be present at
       startup or shutdown.

     * S9.6 has multiple ways to connect a computer either directly or via various bridges:

          * Ethernet directly

          * Wirelessly, for example by Wifi via commodity Wifi-Ethernet routers

          * USB to CAN bridge

Issues

   S9.6 is in the process of specifying testing and monitoring protocols. The data transfer protocols
   (datagrams, streaming, event notification) are in place. A protocol for remote logging is under
   discussion, but there is not yet a reference implementation. Only preliminary work has been done on
   protocols for remote testing and diagnosis.

    

                                                    Simple

   Goal: Make it easy for a novice customers to install and configure without technical knowledge (should
   be easier than DCC systems).

   Measure: A customer can change the configuration of any device at any time with a simple interface that
   includes text descriptions of settings, thus greatly reducing the need for a manual and required level
   of learned expertise. This mechanism should also reduce the support burden to the manufacturer. In
   addition:

     * You can disconnect a node, reconnect it somewhere else on the same net and have is still work
       without having to make any configuration changes.

Features

   Configuration methods:

     * S9.6 defines a push-button configuration method that will allow simple configuration without the
       need for attached PC or configuration device2. (This is defined so that it will inter-operate, but
       manufacturers may omit it from their products if they wish) In this simplest form, a few button
       pushes on two boards will associate them so an input on one triggers the output on another, e.g. a
       pushbutton operates a distance turnout.

     * For more complex configuration, S9.6 nodes all include detailed self-descriptions in a defined
       format. This permits the construction of stand-alone configuration tools that will just connect and
       work, no separate PC needed. We anticipate that limited tools of this kind will be available for
       about the current cost of a DCC throttle.

     * Programs in personal computers are full S9.6 NMRAnet partners, and will be able to provide
       configuration assistance limited only by the ingenuity and motivation of their programmers.

   Simplicity:

     * Configuring events in S9.6 is simplified by the world-unique event ID numbers. Configuration tools
       don't have to keep records of event IDs used, avoid conflicts, or generally have to worry about them
       at all.

     * Since each node has a unique node ID, they can be easily be cross-referenced on the Internet so that
       manufacturers can supply support, including configuration tools and manuals.

     * Because the S9.6 48-bit node IDs are world-wide unique, free relocation of nodes without risk of
       node collisions is guaranteed. Nodes can be moved around, and working modules interconnected, with
       no reprogramming required to retain their existing function.

Issues

     * S9.6 48-bit node IDs and 64-bit event numbers incur a moderate penalty in terms of space and search
       time, however, this is mitigated by:

          * This space/time penalty is far outweighed by the benefit in terms of ease of use, safety, and
            reduced software costs.

          * The full node ID only needs to be saved by its owner and bridges, and not other nodes.

          * On CAN, a shortened 12-bit alias, the NIDa, is used for the full node ID.

          * The price of memory is falling, and memory other than EEPROM can be used to store events, such
            as flash memory.

          * Search algorithms can be chosen that allow event matching with only a minor speed penalty over
            shorter event numbers.

    

    

                                                  Expandable

   Goal: Allow very large layouts (a higher-level of technical knowledge required is OK for large layouts).

   Measure: A very large museum layout might be divided into distinct segments that work together as a
   single network. You can use a device, such as a hub, repeater, or switch, to connect multiple segments
   to form a single network.

Features

     * S9.6 is designed to not only handle large layouts, but to minimize the problems inherent in a large
       heterogeneous layout.

     * S9.6 supports Modular Layouts and large Modular Meets, by minimizing the integration tasks required
       when joining multiple independent layouts and net segments into a cohesive whole. To this end, it
       has these features:

          * Use of 48-bit node IDs ensure there are no node conflicts.

          * Use of 64-bit event numbers with an associated allocation methodology eliminates event number
            conflicts and re-programming tasks other than those required to integrate adjacent sub-layouts
            by configuring their mutual edge events.

          * Multiple integrated transports including, but not limited to Ethernet and CAN, are available.
            This allows local area CAN nets that can be linked by a higher-speed backbone bus.

          * Intelligent bridges with automatic routing and traffic-limiting are available. Messages are
            transferred to the network segments containing nodes that need them, and they don't appear
            where not needed, all automatically.

          * Multiple computers can be running configurations tools simultaneously.

          * Virtual nodes can be defined and run testing across the network.

     * S9.6 supports museum and other large layouts using these features:

          * It uses off-the-shelf components, such as CAN-USB bridges, Ethernet routers and wireless
            routers.

          * It utilizes industrial-strength noise resistant local network hardware, including Ethernet and
            CAN.

          * It enables use of multiple hard-, firm-, and software solutions for the control and display of
            the net. Multiple glass-panels, configuration tools, and testing tools can be used
            simultaneously.

Issues

                                                   Flexible

   Goal: Customers can easily connect many-to-many devices, and connect to legacy systems.

   Measure: You can buy devices from any manufacturer that were designed without knowledge of the other
   devices and make them work together.

Features

     * Many-to-many:

          * S9.6 uses a clean Producer/Consumer (P/C) Event Model which allows for many-to-many
            interactions between devices.

     * No knowledge of other devices:

          * S9.6 uses large node and event IDs which are world-wide unique3. This means that there will be
            no conflicts between devices or their events.

          * The S9.6 P/C model lets devices from two different manufacturer work seamlessly together,
            without either device having knowledge of how the other works internally.

     * Legacy Systems:
       S9.6 is able to connect to legacy systems through the use of intelligent gateways, which make the
       legacy system look like a functional set of S9.6 devices. For example:

          * MERG RPC is a serial bus that transfers raw data to and from a 'stack' of input/output modules.
            An intelligent gateway stores the RPC stack's state, and reports state changes as S9.6 events
            and responds to S9.6 events by transferring the changed state to the RPC stack.

          * DCC accessory decoder commands are directly translated into S9.6 events by encapsulating the
            DCC command and DCC-address into S9.6 64-bit event numbers. Similarly, S9.6 events are
            translated to their corresponding DCC packet by extracting the command and DCC-address
            information from the S9.6 event number.

Issues

     * S9.6 connections to legacy systems are in the demonstration-phase.

    

                                                  Extensible

   Goal: Allow additional functionality to be added easily, whether by the NMRA, or manufacturers.

   Measure: The NMRA can add Standards and/or RPs on top of the bus to define new capabilities.
   Additionally, manufacturers can add their own proprietary functionally between their own devices.

Features

     * S9.6 provides three basic communications mechanisms (event notification; datagrams; stream transfer)
       that provide a strong basis for higher-level functionality.

     * The use of a pure Producer/Consumer Model for global notification in S9.6 provides excellent
       opportunity to add functionality while maintaining compatibility.

Issues

   The S9.6 development team have had only preliminary discussions about adding proprietary protocols,
   however, they see no technical impediment to this goal.

   S9.6 defines how the Node and Event universal identifiers are allocated by a combination of delegation
   and central (NMRA) record-keeping. A similar mechanism for future protocol identifiers is yet to be
   defined.

    

                                            Bi-directional Support

   Goal: Supports bi-directional exchange of information.

   Measure: All products should be able transmit and receive information to/from the bus. Feedback of
   information such as Block Occupancy Detection should be fundamental to the bus. As such, success here
   would be that a more sophisticated BOD could report not only occupancy, but optional additional
   information, such as the locomotive or rolling stock unique number, as well as yet-to-be determined
   information.

Features

     * S9.6's clean Consumer/Producer Event Model allows painless transfer of stateless data.

     * S9.6's Datagrams and Streams will allow ample room for transfer of state information.

Issues

     * The S9.6 has only had preliminary discussions regarding stateful data, and in particular regarding
       location state, such as will be required with RFID, Bi-Di, bar-coding, IR and other train/block
       detection methods. However, we do not see any technical impediment to implementation.

    

    

                                                   Free IP

   Goal: The Standards and/or RPs should be free from intellectual-property restrictions from parties other
   than the NMRA.

Features

   NMRAnet S9.6 uses standard communications links (CAN, Ethernet, USB, etc) without modification.
   Manufacturers who use commercial implementations of those, and comply with the conditions of their
   suppliers, will have no IP issues. Manufacturers who want to create their own "almost-Ethernet",
   "almost-CAN", etc might possibly encounter IP issues, but their solutions won't be NMRAnet S9.6
   compliant in any case.

   The NMRAnet S9.6 documents, prototype code and examples, are all being developed and made available
   under Open Source licenses. Once an agreement on NMRA standardization has been reached, they will be
   freely and generally available to all. Depending on their business model, manufacturers will have to
   write their own manuals and software to implement NMRAnet S9.6 or comply with the license terms of other
   developers who provide solutions.

Issues

   The NMRA's own licensing terms are inconsistent with this point.

    

                                              Transport Agnostic

   Goal: Allow different transport mechanisms for messages.

   Measure: If a company has another method for connecting devices, such as wireless or another wired
   method, they can substitute their own transport mechanism and still use all the other standards/RPs and
   automated test suites.

Features

     * S9.6 is designed to be transport agnostic, and is being prototyped specifically on TCP/IP (Ethernet,
       wireless) and CAN networks. It can be implemented on transports such as multi-drop RS-232, RS485,
       serial phone lines, cell-phones and others not yet designed by using the S9.6 concept of a "wire
       protocol" to map specific NMRAnet S9.6 messages onto a specific transport mechanism.

     * Use of a CAN bus imposes specific constraints and features, however, S9.6 mitigates these in the
       CAN-specific wire protocol:

          * CAN frame size is limited

               * S9.6 uses 29-bit headers in order to maximize CAN frame length to 13-bytes.

               * S9.6 48-bit node IDs are converted to shorter local12-bit aliases.

               * S9.6 Datagrams allow transfer of data greater than 8-bytes.

               * S9.6 Streams allow large quantities of data to be transferred.

          * CAN frame-headers are required to be unique

               * S9.6 node ID aliases are present in every frame header and guarantees it is unique,
                 collisions cannot occur.

   As a consequence CAN nodes are full participants in the larger NMRAnet network. Similar adaptions should
   allow NMRAnet to work over any reliable transport mechanism.

Issues

   No entry

    

                                                Train Agnostic

   Goal: Support controlling trains when the network is connected to a train-control system.

   Measure: The NMRAnet should be able to connect, via bridge products, to any train control system, such
   as DCC, DC, or PWM, to allow interaction with each other. A hand-held throttle on NMRAnet can control a
   locomotive on DCC, DC, or PWM. Similarly, you can have a bridge between a DCC command station and the
   NMRAnet that will allow the DCC hand controller, for example, to throw a turnout motor attached to
   NMRAnet.

Features

     * The S9.6 group is fully committed to meeting this goal. Prototyping has started on LocoNet and DCC
       connections.

Issues

     * Only very preliminary steps have been taken to achieve what is hoped is a solution that is simple,
       elegant, unifying, and comprehensive.

     * We note that this criteria is inconsistent with the NMRA charge to the NMRAnet Working Group. This
       must be resolved at some higher organizational level.

    

                                                 Discoverable

   Goal: Allow a user to find out what devices are connected and how they’re configured on a layout.

   Measure: You can connect a laptop to a layout it has never seen before. The configuration software can
   query the layout, provide a list of all the nodes attached to the layout, display how each node is
   configured, and show how nodes are interconnected and interact with each other. In addition, you can
   save the configuration of an entire layout and later restore it (in case you want to make some changes,
   and then decide to go back to what you had).

Features

     * Connection and discovery:

          * Because each S9.6 device has a factory set unique ID, devices will never conflict with
            preexisting devices on the layout, and many can be added to a layout simultaneously without
            concern about duplicate addresses.

     * Configuration and device teaching:

          * S9.6 has well defined protocol to retrieve P/C event use from nodes.

          * S9.6 nodes contain compressed XML containing a description of the device. This is sufficiently
            complete that a de-novo node can be added to a layout and then queried as to its
            characteristics such that it can be programmed/configured.

          * Collateral information will be obtainable via files or online, including test suites, manuals,
            and configuration tools.

          * In addition, at the manufacturer's discretion, devices may be programmable using the S9.6
            protocol for local programming, or programmed by a standalone programming device.

          * To get the full benefit of a device, it is likely a dedicated or generic software program, the
            equivalent of open-source JMRI project, will be preferable, as it will allow the use of user
            descriptive terms for all of the programming parameters.

     * Saving and restoring device content and inter-device relationships:
       S9.6 will have a number of ways to back-up device content and inter-device relationships.

          * As described above, there is a well-described S9.6 protocol to retrieve device relationships.

          * S9.6 device content can be read and written using the Datagram protocol.

          * In addition, device content is serializable and is downloaded, copied and stored using the S9.6
            Streaming protocol.

          * The stored content can then be restored to original device, or another device if the user wants
            to duplicate or replace a defective device. The restored or replacement device will be a full
            participant in the original device's relationships.

Issues

     * Preliminary specification of the XML schema has been made, but further development is necessary.

     * Preliminary adaptation of JMRI tools to S9.6 has been made, and requires roll-out once licensing
       issues have been resolved with the NMRA.

                                               Self Describing

   Goal: Devices should describe themselves.

   Measure: You can connect a computer to a type of node that it has never seen before. The computer can
   display the manufacturer of the node, the number of devices inside the node, the configuration
   variables, actions, reaction, etc. All of this information can be used to generate a user-friendly
   interface on the fly that allows configuring a node with text prompts.

Features

     * Because each S9.6 device has a factory set unique ID, devices will never conflict with preexisting
       devices on the layout, and many can be added to a layout simultaneously without concern.

     * S9.6 has well defined protocol to retrieve P/C event use from nodes.

     * S9.6 nodes contain compressed XML containing a description of the device. This is sufficiently
       complete that a de-novo node can be added to a layout and then queried as to its characteristics
       such that it can be programmed to some basic level.

     * Collateral information will be obtainable via files or online, including test suites, manuals, and
       configuration tools.

     * In addition, at the manufacturer's discretion, devices may be programmable using the S9.6 protocol
       for local programming, or programmed by a standalone programming device.

     * To get the full benefit of a device, it is likely a dedicated or generic software program, the
       equivalent of JRMI, will be preferable, as it will allow the use of user descriptive terms for all
       of the programming parameters.

Issues

     * Preliminary specification of the XML schema has been made, but further development is necessary.

     * Preliminary adaptation of JMRI tools to S9.6 has been made, and requires roll-out.

    

                                                   Testable

   Goal: Allow components to be easily tested for compliance.

   Measure: Components can be easily tested for compliance using available tools and standard test suite.

Features

     * S9.6 documents a basic set of messages, which can be automatically tested by a test suite. It also
       documents three specific protocols (event exchange; datagrams; streams) that can be individually
       tested. In general, testability has been a criterion all along.

     * Testing suggestions are being written into each draft Standard and RP. These form a starting point
       for a test suite. Having them right in the S&RP document ensures that product developers are aware
       of them.

     * As part of developing prototype implementations, suitable tests are being developed in parallel.

Issues

     * The development of a S9.6 test suite is only in preliminary stages. As of this writing on June 6,
       2010, there are 5005 lines of testing code implemented and available in SVN.

    

                                                  Compliance

   Goal: A name protected by a trademark that NMRA can use to help ensure compliance.

   Measure: A manufacturer should be able to obtain a license to use the NMRANet name and logo when their
   product successfully passes a test suite. To comply with these standards a product should be capable of
   being connected to a real layout or a “white-box” simulation of a layout and pass all designed tests.
   These tests would examine the products ability to keep up with bandwidth requirements as well as make
   100% compatible protocol exchange. Using standardized busses such as CAN, USB, Ethernet, ZigBee or
   802.11 wireless negates the need for a low level compliance test.

Features

     * S9.6 uses industry standard connections. By not modifying these standards at all,
       commercial-off-the-shelf implementations require only limited testing at the electrical level.4 The
       first version of S9.6 specifically includes:

          * Ethernet -- A ubiquitous high-speed high capacity network, which is available on almost all
            computers and many cellphones. Common usage network ancillary devices are available at low
            commodity prices including hubs, routers, and wireless routers.

          * CAN -- An industrial strength differential two-wire bus, designed by Bosch for the automobile
            market, commonly used in industry and academia for interconnection of equipment, including high
            electrical-noise areas such as factory floors and accelerators. Again, bridges, extenders, and
            relays are easily available.

     * S9.6 can also be applied to other buses, such as I2C, multi-drop RS232 and RS485, and to wireless,
       such as 802.54.2 and WiFi. By staying with standard communications links, additional capability can
       be added without requiring the development of communications test suites.

   Above the level of the inter-node connections, NMRAnet S9.6 operates with the exchange of well-formatted
   messages and state-machine based protocols. Conformance with these can be explicitly tested. NMRAnet
   S9.6 documents clearly list which parts are mandatory (must be implemented and tested), which components
   are optional, and which parts of the documents are just non-normative discussion.

Issues

     * Only preliminary work has been done on a specifying a test suite. It will likely take considerable
       work to make a robust but simple testing suite.

     * There are issues associated with permission to use NMRAnet for development before product
       certification; timing of testing vs product announcement; fair-use and comparative use of
       trademarks; etc that are not S9.6-specific issues, and need to be resolved by higher level within
       the NMRA. Until those are resolved, it's not possible to say whether the NMRAnet S9.6 approach is

                                                First Time Use

   Goal: A new user can buy a device and have it work.

   Measure: A user new to NMRAnet can buy a single device, take it home and have it do something useful and
   interesting without having to buy any other special hardware, or another device.

Features

     * S9.6 has world-wide unique node IDs, which means that new users do not need to worry about conflict
       between nodes, in fact they do not need to concern themselves with IDs at all.

     * S9.6 will have a comprehensive push-button programming model5, notionally called the "blue/gold
       algorithm" after the recommended color of the buttons, which allows new owners to connect two nodes
       out of the box and make them fully able to interact via event messages.

Issues

     * We need to put some work into creating introductory articles, convention clinics, etc to help model
       railroaders become comfortable with NMRAnet S9.6. The excellent work done by the NMRA DCC WG to get
       DCC accepted is an example of what's needed.

   1 The NMRA has specified these Goals and Measures in a separate document.

   2 We are only beginning to prototype the mechanism for push-button configuration of nodes (e.g. without
   an attached PC). We're sure it will work; we're not so sure whether model railroaders will like it.
   We've got a PC-based simulation you're welcome to try. It simulates several nodes, their pushbuttons &
   LEDs, and their input/output connections on the screen so you can play with the push-button protocol. If
   you want a copy, ask on the development mailing list or build it from SVN.

   3 No formal mechanism has been established for the distribution of S9.6 IDs. However, IDs have already
   been assigned via NMRA manufacturer numbers, NMRA membership, and MERG membership numbers. We would
   expect that the controlling body would set-up some mechanism, possibly by an automated Internet form,
   that will distribute IDs to other manufacturers, organizations, groups, and individuals on a as-needed
   basis.

   4 A separate decisions to be made about testing of non-standard implementations of the low level
   connections. Are they forbidden, just require extra testing, or are they permitted? As an example,
   consider a manufacturer who wanted to develop their own CAN controller, instead of using pre-existing
   silicon, or provide their own protocol on a wireless link instead of using an IEEE-specified protocol.

   5 We are only beginning to prototype the mechanism for push-button configuration of nodes (e.g. without
   an attached PC). We're sure it will work; we're not so sure whether model railroaders will like it.
