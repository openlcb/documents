Principles of Standards Development and Adoption

This note lists some actions that should be considered as part of adopting a document from "Draft" to "Approved" status.

 - The [OlcbChecker](https://github.com/bobjacobsen/OlcbChecker) should include a test plan and checker code for the new or changed capability
   - This should be made available early to node implementors so they can confirm coexistence of their products with any new or changed functionality
   
 - There should be at least two implementations that interoperate and pass the above checks
    - ideally, these would have been developed independently
 
 - The updated document(s) should be posted to the [OpenLCB Group](https://groups.io/g/openlcb) and comments accepted for a week
   - Those comments should be addressed on the group list, and if consensus exists, appropriate changes should be made
