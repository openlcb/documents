Certification Index</H1>
<P>This is the head page of the OpenLCB certification web.</P>
<P>OpenLCB provides procedures for testing whether equipment
(hardware and software) meets the OpenLCB specifications.  We do this
for several reasons:</P>
<P>to help insure that OpenLCB equipment from multiple sources all
works well together,</P>
<P>to help guide people creating OpenLCB implementations, and</P>
<P>to force our OpenLCB specifications effort to stay very concrete
and implementable.</P>
<P>This page provides links to OpenLCB certification procedures.
These are generally checklists to be filled out. Some of these use
OpenLCB-provided test software and (rarely) special hardware.  To
certify your project, print out the relevant checklist, and do each
step.  If all pass, save the filled-out copy of the checklist.</P>
<P>The certification procedures evolve with time. They are
version-controlled in SVN, so that we can establish what the current
procedure was at any particular time.  In general, you can refer to a
board or program as OpenLCB-certified if it passed the procedure as
of the time is was created.</P>
