<H1>Event Teaching/Learning Protocol</H1>
<P>Entry-level OpenLCB users should be able to buy two OpenLCB nodes
and configure them to do something useful with only the pushbutton(s)
and LED(s) on them, without requiring a separate configuration tool,
computer, etc. 
</P>
<P>This document outlines the OpenLCB protocol for doing this. It
works without any central configuration mechanism, nor even any
global knowledge of which producers and consumers are being
configured.</P>
<P>This method is based on easily creating a known-unique new Event
ID. When Event IDs are much longer than Node ID numbers (NIDs), it's
straightforward to do this by using the NID followed by a sequential
number when a new unique Event ID is needed. 
</P>
<P>This protocol does not mandate how a node defines its local UI.
See the separate “<A HREF="examples/BlueGoldConfig.html">Blue-Gold
Protocol</A>” document for that.</P>
<P>Nodes may also be configured using other mechanisms, including
direct loading of configuration. Techniques for that are described
<A HREF="MemoryConfigurationProtocol.html">elsewhere</A>.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Simplified Description</H2>
<P>Producer-nodes (ones that implement buttons, toggle switches,
BODs, etc) and consumers-nodes (signals, leds, displays, layout
lighting, etc) need to be configured to use a common EventID, such
that activating a producer will send the common EventID, which will
cause one or more consumers to activate. 
</P>
<P>The protocol uses external mechanisms, e.g. walking around and
pushing buttons, to select producers and consumers which will learn
the common EventID. A single producer or consumer then provides the
EventID that is to be learned in a “teach EventID” message.
Specifically:</P>

	<LI><P>On one or more 'learner'-nodes, select a number of
	producers/consumers (p/c's).</P>
	<LI><P>On the 'teacher'-node select the p/c which will teach the
	other nodes and activate the teaching. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>As a result, activating one of the producers will activate
	all the linked consumers.

<H2 CLASS="western">Default Producer and Consumer EventIDs</H2>
<P>For this method to work, producers and consumers must start
configured to unique EventIDs not in use anywhere else. This section
describes how to ensure that.</P>
<P>Assume that a node can detect N conditions, each of which should
send a unique P/C Event ID (the non-unique case is discussed below).
The factory default condition is that each of those conditions will
produce a PCER message with a P/C Event ID of the board's unique NID
followed by the input number (1, 2, etc). This is enough to get the
board up and working. 
</P>
<P>For example, a board with 48-bit NID 0x123456789ABC would by
default send Event ID 0x123456789ABC001 when its first input
condition happened, 0x123456789ABC002 when its second input condition
happened, etc. These Event IDs could then be counted on for no- or
low-configuration use. 
</P>
<P>Similarly, by default a board with M consumers will start with
those consumers configured to match default EventIDs consisting of
the NID followed by a sequential number that doesn't overlap with the
producer sequence described above.</P>
<P>If the board is reset to its default configuration, e.g. a
“factory reset”, it <U>must</U> set the default EventIDs to new
numbers. If it had N EventIDs before, it could e.g. start with a
suffix of N+1 to its NodeID. If it doesn't do this, the configuration
process could reuse an EventID for a different purpose, causing
conflicts.</P>
<P>There is a theoretical possibility that a node could run out of
default EventIDs due to an excessive number of reset operations.
There are 2<SUP>16</SUP> = 65535 possible suffixes. These can
seemingly be consumed rapidly if there are e.g. 200 default EventIDs
in a node, so that each reset raises the suffix by 200. But even in
that unlikely case, it will take more than 300 factory resets to
overflow. That's enough for a useful lifetime for a board. If a board
has a very large number of defaults, it can build EventIDs using two
or more consequtive NodeIDs, effectively providing more bits in the
address space for the suffix. (That needs a figure to show the space;
make it clear the node has one NodeID in any case)</P>
