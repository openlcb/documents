Protocol Proposal</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This is a proposal for a
general-purpose protocol for “reserving” resources, e.g.
reserving unique access to a locomotive node or reserving unique
access for memory-configuration protocol. It grew out of (and in some
places is a cut&amp;paste from) capability in the
memory-configuration protocol.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Note that this has <U>not</U> been
agreed to by the general OpenLCB group. It's just a proposal. Details
will change.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The basic idea is to provide a
test-and-set approach to reservation. It goes through datagrams (but
could be modified to use message level, which might be a bood idea if
the messages can be kept short enough).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Preferences</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Small nodes shouldn't need a lot of processing power, e.g. to
	compress or decompress data in real time. Memory usage should also
	be limited, but is a second priority.</P>
	<LI><P>Operations should be state-less and idempotent to simplify
	software at both ends.</P>
	<LI><P>Multiple independent reservation operations can proceed at
	the same time. Multiple devices should be able to make reservations
	on separate nodes at the same time. Multiple overlapping
	reservations of overlapping resources in the same node should be
	possible. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>For efficiency, reservation operations should fit into a
	single-frame CAN datagram (or small).</P>
	<LI><P>The mechanism for indicating which resource is being reserved
	should be general, extensible, and distributed.</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Discussion</H2>
<P>To have a general-purpose protocol for reserving things, you have
to specify what those things are. They're accessed within a specific
node via addressed messages, so NodeID doesn't have to be part of the
resource identification. But you need to have several, so that a
given node can be separately locked for e.g. memory-configuration
protocol, and also 5 different times for the 5 locomotives it's
controlling.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Small is good, so that small nodes can deal with reservations
	easier. One or two bytes would be ideal.</P>
	<LI><P>There needs to be a way to allocate it. Using e.g. the byte
	value of a datagram-protocol ID would be nice because it's
	unambiuguous, and already allocated. But it doesn't work for
	datagram protocols that provide more than one thing to lock, nor for
	stream-based or other non-datagram-based protocols.</P>
	<LI><P>A full unique-ID (6 bytes) is easy to allocate, and makes it
	easy to associate event IDs with various lock indications. But it's
	a lot of space.</P>
	<LI><P>Compromise on two bytes: The first is flags and expansion,
	the second is a datagram-protocol ID, stream-protocol ID, etc as
	indicated by the flags.</P>
	<LI><P>But that doesn't fit in a single-frame datagram, so fall back
	to one byte, allocated via a common spreadsheet, using
	datagram-protocol values when available.</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Protocol</H2>
<P>Send the following datagrams to reserve, release, etc.</P>

<P>The configuring node sends a Lock datagram with its NodeID. If no
node has locked this node, indicated by zero content in the lock
memory, the incoming NodeID is placed in the lock memory. If a node
has locked this node, the non-zero NodeID in the lock memory is not
changed. In either case, the content of the lock memory is returned
in the reply. This acts as a test&amp;set operation, and informs the
requesting node whether it successfully reserved the node. To release
the node, repeat the lock operation with a zero NodeID. The lock
memory is set to zero when the node is reset. 
</P>
<P>If receiving node doesn't implement the particular resource, it
should reply with an error instead of Lock/Reserve Reply. (Another
reason to go with messages instead of datagrams, because Optional
Interaction Rejected has better error code semantics)</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Remaining Issues</H2>
<P>This grew out of the datagram-based configuration protocol, but
should probably be just made into two messages. That occupies the
same space, and removes the need to acknowledge the datagrams. The
messages are small and have immediate execution, so there's no
problem with having them be messages.</P>
<P>To ease implementation, zero should not be a valid resource ID.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Local vs global reserved-object IDs</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Reservation involves at least 3 nodes:
the one with the resource being reserved, the one holding the
reservation, and one or more others who'd like a reservation but
can't get it right now.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The one holding the resource doesn't
actually need to know about the resource ID, as the reservation
status doesn't change its actions (it's a reservation, not a lock). 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But the others have to agree on the
value for the system to work. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">That indicates you need either a set of
well-known global IDs, or a way to ask about locally defined IDs. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The writeup above is mostly about
former. IDs are well known and associated with a particular protocol:
&quot;reserve use of configuration protocol&quot;. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But you might want to have a more
general mechanism that can reference e.g. 1-of-n objects in a node:
&quot;reserve use of 5th virtual thing&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">That would require more protocol
support, but certainly could be done. If you want that someday, this
protocol should stay in datagrams to have expansion room.</P>
