<H1>OpenLCB Example: Start of Day Operations</H1>
<P>These examples discussion various aspects of bringing up an
OpenLCB, including adding segments and individual nodes to a running
OpenLCB. 
</P>
<P>For an OpenLCB that's separated into multiple segments, e.g.
several modules on CAN networks connected via an Ethernet backbone,
it is likely that the segments will initialize at different times. 
</P>
<H2>Node Verification</H2>
<P>When a node becomes operational, it sends out an &quot;Initialization
Complete&quot; message which other nodes can use to e.g. update
status tables, trigger notifications, etc. It follows this with
notification of the Event IDs it wants to receive/consume and the
ones it is capable of sending/producing. 
</P>
<P>When a node comes up, it can check on the existance of other nodes
several ways: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To check for the existance of a
	specific node, send a &quot;Verify Node Serial Number (Addressed)&quot;
	message to the specific node. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To get a list of all currently
	reachable nodes, send a &quot;Verify Node Serial Number
	(Unadressed)&quot; message. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To check for the existance of at
	least one node that produces a specific Event ID, e.g. one consumed
	by a node, the &quot;Producer Identification&quot; standard
	interaction can be used. There is no requirement that every Event ID
	configured into an given consumer exist, so a lack of response to
	this interaction is not an error, but it can provide useful
	information. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>To check for the existance of at least one node that consumes
	a specific Event ID, e.g. one produced by a node, the &quot;Consumer
	Identification&quot; standard interaction can be used. There is no
	requirement that every Event ID configured into an given producer
	exist, so a lack of response to this interaction is not an error,
	but it can provide useful information. 
	</P>
</OL>
<H2>Configuration Upload</H2>
<P><I>Is there a need for a mechanism by which a newly-operational
node can e.g. call for download of configuration information, large
files (e.g. sounds) or similar? Might be nice to not have to store
them locally, particularly with large bandwidth OpenLCBs. Global
events can be used to call for specific resources, because they carry
the source node ID of the emitting node.</I></P>
<H2>State Restoration</H2>
<P>Producer/Consumer systems react to state changes, which are
transferred as Events. When a node first becomes operational,
however, it may not have any knowledge of the existing state. It
can't figure out how to act until the next external change results in
an Event, which is distributed as a PCER message. 
</P>
<P>Nodes that power up independently will operate, but higher level
mechanisms are needed for to initialize their inputs and outputs as
part of the entire layout. Those mechanisms can be triggered by e.g.
&quot;Initialization Complete&quot; messages from the
newly-functional node. 
</P>
<P>Several mechanisms are available for implementation: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>A store-load mechanism can capture and store the state of
	nodes, and restore those latter. This puts the layout back to the
	earlier state, but doesn't handle any state changes that have
	happened since the state was captured. There's (currently) no
	mechanism to trigger the store operation.  
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The store operation can capture the
	current state of consumers on the layout via the &quot;Identify
	Consumers&quot; common message. Nodes that fully implement this
	reply with the current state of their consumers. Restoration of this
	via PCER messages will restore the output state. Note that it's not
	required that nodes know the state of the devices attached to their
	outputs. Depending on what that device is, they simply might not
	have any way to know.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"></P>
	<LI><P>The newly-functional node can use the Producer Identification
	interaction to get &quot;valid&quot; bits from (all) the Producers
	of the Event IDs that can effect the newly-functional node. This is
	not fool-proof, however, as not all nodes can produce those, and
	there might be history (e.g. which Producer fired most recently)
	that can't be recovered. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">Sample scenario:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">A) For each event ID being consumed, send
a global “Identify Producers” message.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">B) When (if) a “Producer Identified”
message comes back, check the “uncertain” bit.  If the message is
not uncertain, and the “valid” bit is set, consumers should act
as if a PCER message with this event ID has been received.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">C) If more then one “Producer
Identified” message without the “uncertain” bit is returned,
it's possible that the “valid” bits will not agree.  There are
several ways to deal with this (1) consider it an error to be
reported, (2) just act on the 1<SUP>st</SUP> one or (3) just act on
the last one.  The system is inconsistent, so it's not clear that any
of these are right or wrong.</P>
