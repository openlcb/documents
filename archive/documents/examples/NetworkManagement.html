<H1>OpenLCB Example: Network Management</H1>
<P>&quot;Network management&quot; means different things to different
people. This node discusses some of these. 
</P>
<P>In general, OpenLCB does not require any central resources at run
time. (There are some centralized aspects to the allocation of Node
ID numbers) Instead, the various forms of node management can be done
by one or more nodes that implement various standard and optional
interactions. 
</P>
<H2>Node Monitor</H2>
<P>A &quot;node monitor&quot; checks to make sure that all known
nodes are reachable.... 
</P>
<P>If a device wants to detect nodes that become unreachable, it can
periodically poll nodes with a &quot;Verify Node ID&quot; addressed
to the specific node. Since every message carries the Node ID of the
originating node, these polls are only required to check nodes which
are not emitting other messages within the required time interval. 
</P>
<P>To find all currently accessible nodes, the node monitor can issue
an unaddressed (global) “Verify Node ID”, which will generate a
response from all accessible and functional nodes.  This should be
done sparingly, however, as it will generate a lot of unnecessary
traffic on a functioning OpenLCB network.</P>
<H2>Error Logger</H2>
<P>An &quot;error logger&quot; centralizes access to error
information from nodes. The <a href="../notes/Logging.html">note on Logging </a>provides more information
on the OpenLCB logging protocol. 
</P>
<P>An error logger can learn about new log entries either by
listening for the well-known EventID that indicates a new entry, or
by polling a list of nodes for new entries.</P>
<H2>State Save/Restore</H2>
<P>Provides a way to save and restore the state of all or part of an
OpenLCB installation.....

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Note that events are not, themselves,
indications of state. Rather, they are (possible) transitions of the
overall state of the layout.  Knowning that two separate producers
sent different events (one “on” and the other “off”) doesn't
tell you the state of the railroad, because you don't know which
order those events occurred or whether anything else changed.</P>
