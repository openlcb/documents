<H1>Crossing-gate Example</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This is an example of how a model
railroader might first encounter OpenLCB by using it to automate a
crossing gate.</P>
<H2>Basic Setup</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A user wants to operate a crossing gate
from two block detectors (left and right). Specifically, the crossing
gate assembly is made by Manufacturer A, and has a bus interface. The
block detectors come with a single block interface card.

has neither parts nor knowledge to reuse.</P>

<H2>Operation</H2>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Layout power comes on .

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Each of the two boards initializes
	itself using its on-board resources. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Soon after power is up and stable,
	each board transmits an &quot;I am here&quot; message which starts
	the assignment of a local ID process.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">After the local IDs are assigned,
	the occupancy detector checks the status of the monitored tracks.
	The default track status is by default unoccupied; if the track
	status at this point is the same as the default status, no event
	needs to be reported. If the tracks status at this point is
	different from the default status, the appropriate event is
	generated.  (Optionally, the board can have the default status
	configurable, and whether the current state is always reported).   
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When a change to track occupancy
	is detected, the occupancy-detector board sends the relevant tie-ID
	as a message. This occurs on either type of change, for either
	section.  (Optionally, the occupancy board can have debouncing
	and/or delay built in, which might or might not be configurable. In
	any case, once an event is reported, the device is considered to be
	in the reported state, and any change in the state requires another
	event to be reported).

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When it receives an event message
	from the occupancy detector, the crossing gate module uses its own
	internal logic and configuration information to act.  This might be
	as simple as &quot;gate down when either track occupied, stays down
	until both tracks cleared.  But it might be more complicated, such
	as &quot;gate down when one track goes occupied, gate goes up when
	that track clears, even if other track is occupied' (directional
	logic). Etc.

<H2>Diagnosis of Faults</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">[This section describes some basic
diagnostic capabilities. As such, it's not clear that it fits a
&quot;normal operation&quot; scenario, but we've got so much invested
in the context of this scenario, and diagnostics are so necessary in
practice, that I've included it. Some of the stuff mentioned here is
not replicated above in the interest of brevity, but it could be)].

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Each board carries an LED (the &quot;bus
activity LED&quot;) that flashes when the node sees a good frame from
_another_ node on the bus. Note that this LED does not flash when
this node sends a message. The flashing does not depend on whether
this node acts on the message, or even is interested in it. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Each board also carries an LED (the
&quot;addressed LED&quot;) that flashes when the node emits a message
or receives a message that it will act on.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Shortly after layout power-up, each
node will therefore flash its bus activity once.  At about the same
time, each node will also flash its bus activity LED, at least once,
to indicate that the connection to the other node(s) is operational. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When one of the occupancy detectors is
triggered, e.g. by a load going on or off the track in that section,
the activity LED should blink on all cards, and the addressed LED
should blink on the occupancy detector card. If that doesn’t
happen, the bus wiring should be tested. Once the bus is working
properly and the cards are configured, the crossing-gate card’s
activity light should also flash when an occupancy detector goes
active, signaling that the crossing gate card is configured to listen
for that event.
