<H1>Example: Blue/Gold User Interface</H1>
<P>Entry-level OpenLCB users should be able to buy two OpenLCB nodes
and configure them to do something useful with only the pushbutton(s)
and LED(s) on them, without requiring a separate configuration tool,
computer, etc. One way to do that is presented here. It's not the
only way, and there is no requirement for a standard for user
interaction in this area.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Underlying Protocol</H2>
<P>The basic configuration operation is to set producers and/or
consumers into “learn” mode, and then send a “LearnEvent”
message carrying an EventID that will be configured into those
producers and/or consumers. The producers and/or consumers then leave
learn mode. For more information, see the asdasd documentation.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Blue/Gold Configuration Method</H2>
<P>There is no standard for how users interact with boards to make
this happen, but in this section we describe a way to do this with
two buttons and optionally LEDs. This provides a basic method that
allows users to configure boards without any additional tools, and
manufacturers are strongly encouraged to include it or something
similar.</P>
<P>Each board has a blue button that is used to select an individual
producer or consumer on the board, and a gold button to tell the
board to send the LearnEvent message. These buttons can also be used
for other purposes, e.g. pushing both buttons for three seconds could
reset the board to factory defaults. Blue and gold are suggested
instead of e.g. red and green to make them very distinctive, even for
color blind or vision challenged users.</P>
<P>To configure a connection between a producer on one board and a
consumer on another, you:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Go to the consumer board, and press the blue button enough
	times to select the specific consumer. That consumer is now in learn
	mode. (If you change your mind, press the button a total of N+1
	times to get back to the original, off state)</P>
	<LI><P>Go to the producer board, and press the bue button enough
	times to select the specific producer. Press the gold button. A
	LearnEvent message with the current EventID of that producer is
	emitted, and the consumer learns to respond to it.</P>
</UL>
<P>Since each producer and consumer starts with a unique default
EventID configured in, this will always create a unique connection
that doesn't interfere with others. Note that you could also do it in
the other direction, configuring the producer board to listen to the
consumer board. Also, you can add a new consumer or producer to an
existing connection between producers and consumers using this same
technique.</P>
<P>The optional LEDs can be used to help the user through the
process. For example, the LED associated with the blue button could
flash N times so that the user didn't need to keep count. A LED
associated with the gold button could flash on all participating
boards to assure the user that the process worked.</P>
<P>A manufacturer might improve on this in several ways. For example,
on an input board with 16 inputs that drive producers, you select a
producer for programming with 1-16 pushes of the blue button. The
manufacturer could make this easier by also allowing you to press the
blue button once to light the blue light, then press the button you
want to select. For another example, a turnout driver board with four
turnout outputs might move the outputs as you select the
corresponding consumers: One blue button push sets the 1<SUP>st</SUP>
turnout one way, the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> sets the 1<SUP>st</SUP> turnout
the other way, the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> sets the next turnout, etc. This
makes it clearer which consumer is being selected. If there are local
inputs to control the turnouts, pressing those could also select a
consumer. The important point is that the basic blue/gold method is
also present, even if there are also enhancements, so that simple
programming is always possible.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Configuring An Event in Multiple Producers and
Consumers</H2>
<P>One advantage of P/C is that it's easy to have multiple causes of
an event, and multiple actions in response to that event. For
example, the user might want two separate pushbuttons to set the
turnouts at each end of a siding; that's implemented as two producers
for a specific event (the two pushbuttons), and two consumers (the
two turnout drivers). 
</P>
<P>Using the buttons to configure two consumers to action on a single
P/C Event ID (PCER message) is straightforward: You select the
consumer(s) that need to be programmed with the blue button, then on
another node select a producer or consumer that already knows the
right EventID and press the gold button.</P>
<P>Configuring two producers to use the same P/C Event ID uses the
same ideas.
