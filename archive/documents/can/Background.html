<H1>CAN Background Information</H1>
<P>Not part of the proposal, this is just a place to dump reference
information and links for CAN implementations. 
</P>
<H2>Headers</H2>
<P>11-bit standard header 
</P>
<P>29-bit extended header and 8-byte payload results in a total
transmission taking about 135 bit times.</P>
<H2>Rate and Length Tradeoffs</H2>
<P>Email on wiring:</P>
<P>The spec for CAT5/CAT5e is less than 188ohm/km, out and back, so
roughly 5.7 ohms for 200 feet. CAT5 cable meets that, the phone cable
doesn't (though it's not very different). These values are _very_ far
from the limits for CAN. Typically CAN is meant to work up to 100
meters with 320 ohms per km (which is what you get with AWG24 wire
plus gold connectors assuming 100 nodes; less nodes means more
length). There's also an outline of this calculation in the excellent
Phillips app note:
&lt;http://www.nxp.com/acrobat_download/applicationnotes/AN96116.pdf&gt;
The real difference is likely to be in characteristic differential
impedance, which is the much more critical parameter for cables of
significant length. 
</P>
<P>The usual CAN physical layer is designed for a terminated
differential impedance of about 124 ohms.</P>
<P>CAT5 is 100+/-5 ohms at 100MHz, somewhat above the frequency for
CAN. Most (modern) phone wiring is ADSL compatible, which requires
100 ohms (with a typical tolerance of 'less than 220' ohms for
typical inter-house lengths; I've never seen a lower tolerance limit,
but these are phone lines with a notional audio-frequency impedance
of 600 ohms so the struggle is usually on the higher end) from 26kHz
to as high as possible, preferably to 1.1MHz for full DSL bandwidth.
That's a lower frequency range than CAN, but for copper/poly wire the
impedance isn't going to change much up to a few hundred MHz. 
</P>
<P>Connections can cause discontinuities, as can stubs to connect to
individual nodes. There are several working group reports and app
notes available on this. There's a particularly thorough ISO working
group report, but unfortunately those are not available on the web
for free AFAIK. The app note referenced above is pretty good, though
(see section 6). Basically, a linear wiring system (node to node to
node to node to ...) with fixed end terminators is going to be able
to easily do 125kHz/100m/100nodes with either of the cables you're
looking at. 
</P>
<P>On length limitations and timing, there's another app note:
&lt;http://www.nxp.com/acrobat_download/applicationnotes/AN10211_2.pdf&gt;
Table 7 is referring to what is stated by the SAE J2284 standard.
That's &quot;High Speed CAN (HSC) for Vehicle Applications at
500kbps&quot;, and it really does say 50 meters (I don't think it's
freely available online, but most college MechE departments will have
access). 50m is probably a little short for a model railroad bus. But
for use in an automobiles and trucks, that's a very reasonable length
limit, and they explicitly discuss various forms of fault-tolerance
operation where short lengths help.</P>
<P>There is also the &quot;thick cable&quot; form of Device Net,
which has a low DC specific cable resistance, typically about the
equivalent of AWG16 wire. There's also a &quot;thin cable&quot; form,
roughly equivalent to the 11898 CAN automotive cable or AWG23.
Particularly for large numbers of nodes, these do result in different
limits. The &quot;thick cable&quot; form typically has about a factor
3 or 4 longer DC limitation than &quot;thin cable&quot;. But all of
these are well above 100m/100nodes, even in the AWG24 form. (There's
a table on page 21 of AN96116)</P>
<P>125Kbps with max-length extended header frames is about 900
frames/second. CAN is very good at running at 100% utilization, so
long as nodes can keep up and a proper set of priorities is in place.</P>
<H2>Connection and Cabling Standards</H2>
<P>The <A HREF="http://www.euromap.org/files/eu66-1.pdf">EUROMAP 66-1
“Protocol for Communication with Peripheral Equipment” standard
</A>defines a CAN interface that's commonly used in shop floor
automation. It uses DB9 connectors that optionally includes a 24V
power line. Each device has two connectors and permanently attached
terminator. The intent is to use male-female cables to connect
modules together, but in practice other arrangements are also used.</P>

<P>This connector wiring is also used for e.g. the Lawicell CAN
adapters.</P>
<H2>Using Existing Cabling</H2>
<P>LocoNet cables are often “conductor swapping”. (The data leads
don't care if the wires are swapped; the Rail Synch leads might if
using transponding, but otherwise don't) This is a problem for using
them with CAN. Otherwise, they're just nice 6-wire untwisted cables.</P>
<P>NCE cab and control buses won't have conductor swaps, at least not
if they've been working.</P>
<P>The breakout panels are probably not electrically compatible with
high-speed CAN.</P>
<H2>Rate, bandwidth and throttling</H2>
<P>CAN is designed to run at 100% usage without problem, and it's
routine for CAN segments in other contexts to run at 100% for
extended times. Therefore, the CAN network does not require any
inter-frame spacing, limitations on bandwidth usage, etc; the segment
can be allowed to run at 100%.</P>
<P>The real limitation is whether the nodes themselves can handle the
full rate of frame arrival. There is (currently) no mechanism in
OpenLCB to throttle the rate of frames arriving at a node, nor is it
easy to create one in a CAN network. The stream and datagram protocol
have been designed to allow a node to efficiently use a very limited
amount of buffer memory, but don't provide mechanisms to limit the
arrival of frames.</P>
<P>For long term reliability, a node <U>must</U> be able to
completely process an entire CAN frame in the time it takes to
receive the next one, which may be as little as 42 (?) bit times.</P>
<H2>CIM/RIM message content and format</H2>
<P>The CIM/RIM algorithm for finding aliases is designed to work
without any CAN errors. Arbitration conflicts are OK, but deliberate
errors are not, because different CAN implementations may deal with
them differently. During execution of the algorithm, some frames
might have the same header. They therefore have to have the same
contents, or else a non-arbitration error can occur.</P>
<P>Although it might be a useful debugging tool, putting the full NID
in the data portion of the frames can cause errors. Therefore, we
decided not to do that.</P>
