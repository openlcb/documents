<H1>CAN Wire Protocol</H1>
<P>CAN bus (ISO 11989-*) provides a very convenient transport medium
for OpenLCB on a specific module or layout. This section defines a
specific wire protocol for transporting OpenLCB over CAN bus. 
</P>
<P>Common OpenLCB messages need to be translated for transport via
CAN 2.0B frames because of the limited CAN frame sizes and to take
advantage of CAN interface features such as filtering on the header
bits. 
</P>
<P>The adaptations include 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A 1-bit priority field has been
	added to provide a coarse high/low message priority 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">NID values are translated to 16
	bit forms. Those forms are dynamically allocated so as to remain
	unique. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Remapping of MTI values to make limited filtering possible. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Note that these adaptions must be possible in standard CAN
components, e.g. bridges and computer adapters must not require
customization to operate with OpenLCB. This provides a stringent
requirement on protocol design, in that OpenLCB CAN cannot require
specific timing, deliberate creation of error cases or specific error
handling. 
</P>
<H2>Physical Layer</H2>
<P>Reference e.g. ISO 11898-2:2003 
</P>
<P>Rate is chosen to be 125kbps to balance length and loading (See
the <A HREF="Background.html">CAN background document</A>)</P>

		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Flat telephone cable isn't
		twisted, and can be either cross-over or straight-through (much
		confusion due to different requirements of different DCC vendors);
		not a good idea to use it.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">LEDuino has a 4 pin header,
		carrying +5V, CanH, CanL, Ground.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">CBUS uses a wiring
		recommendation, instead of specifying a connector. The current CBUS
		cards use a captive-screw connector, allowing connection of
		CANH/CANL, ground, and several different power voltages. A
		recommendation is emerging to use the center pair of CAT5 cable
		(blue for CANH, white/blue for CANL).</P>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Termination provision requirements
	(every node has to have option to terminate in some way? switch?
	Queryable?) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The rise/fall time of CAN signals
	is a controllable parameter.  The MCP2551 transceiver part used in
	e.g. MERG CBUS controls this with an Rs external resistor, by
	default a zero-Ohm jumper.  According to Figure 1-1 of the MCP2551
	datasheet, this corresponds to a slope of above 25V/usec. Mike
	Bolton recommended in September 2009 that future designs use a 100k
	resistor instead to give a better waveform shape at 125kbps by
	limiting the slope to just under 5V/usec.</P>

</UL>
<H2>Link Layer</H2>
<P>OpenLCB common messages are converted, to the extent possible, to
single CAN frames via a one-to-one mapping. 
</P>
<P>The translations include: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The NID Source ID (SID) is mapped to a shorter form, called a
	&quot;NID Alias&quot; (NIDa). The method for this mapping is defined
	such that devices on the CAN segment (e.g. gateways to other parts
	of the larger OpenLCB installation) can determine the full NID that
	corresponds to a particular alias. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Because this alias is still unique on
	the specific CAN segment, it is used in the CAN header for
	arbitration. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">MTIs may have to be shortened,
	depending on bit allocations. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>When possible, Destination NIDs are also mapped to the
	shorter form. In some OpenLCB messages, this is not possible, in
	which case the full NID form is sent; a bit is provided to indicate
	which format is carried. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Decisions to document: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">How to truncate/map the MTI to a
	smaller size. Common form is 16 bits to have lots of space to grow
	at the high end, but only 8 are really needed so far. Try to
	allocate on nibble boundaries to make dumps easy to read.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Nodes must handle full rate
	messages, specifically including messages not addressed to them.
	(The datagram and stream protocols provide ways for nodes to
	indicate whether or not they have sufficient buffering for the next
	transmission, triggering retries as needed)</P>
	<LI><P>A 1-bit field priority field coarsely specifies the priority
	of the message in terms of CAN arbitration to be high (pri=0) or low
	(pri=1). By default, all messages are to be emitted with low
	priority selected. Receiving nodes must not check this bit.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This field is intended for network

<H2>CAN-specific messages and interactions</H2>
<H3>CANid assignment</H3>
<P>The common message format uses full 48-bit node ID numbers to
identify originating nodes and in some case destination nodes. CAN
frames use 16-bit local &quot;NID alias&quot; for these to save space
in the limited-size CAN payload. 
</P>
<P>The standard Verify Node ID Number interaction can be used to get
the full 48-bit NID from a node for translation. At power up each
node must obtain a alias that is locally unique. Gateways will also
have to obtain unique aliases for remote nodes they are proxying on
to the segment.

Translation</H2>
<P>A node must be able to convert traffic on the local CAN segment
into the common message format using only locally available
information. This may be needed e.g. by a gateway or monitoring
program attached to the CAN segment. 
</P>
<P>All traffic on a CAN segment uses aliases for both Source ID
(always) and Destination ID (when the full NID isn't known). 
</P>
<P>If/when a full NID is needed, it can be obtained by sending a
&quot;Verify Node ID Number (Addressed)&quot; message with an
appropriate Destination Node ID in local alias form. The reply will
eventually come back with the Source ID in local alias form and
carrying the full NID in the message content. 
</P>
<P>Aliases for nodes on the local segment are only valid until an
&quot;Initialization Complete&quot; is seen from that alias.
Initialization Complete flags that a node has restarted, and may have
another local alias. 
</P>
<P>Gateways maintain the mapping between remote node's NID and local
alias. If they need to break that mapping, e.g. because they need to
reuse the local alias due to resource limitations in the mapping
tables, they must send a &quot;Mapping Reset&quot; message to force
nodes to drop their alias information. <I>&quot;Mapping Reset&quot;
is a CAN-specific message limited to the segment, but all gateways on
the segment must act on it.</I> 
</P>
<P>Gateways may not be able ensure permanent validity for alias to
remote NIDs. For example, if they have a limited routing table, they
may need to reuse local alias. Before reusing them, they have to send
a &quot;Mapping Reset&quot; frame to drop references to the old NID,
followed by a &quot;Initialization Complete&quot; when the alias is
allocated to a new NID. 
</P>
<H3>Map Acquisition</H3>
<P><A NAME="todo"></A>In order to acquire the map between CANids and
NIDs, a gateway needs to be able to send a CAN frame requiring
&quot;everybody reply with your NID&quot;. Much like Ethernet gateway
mapping, this needs to return the NID of just the specific
CAN-attached hardware, not all the NIDs that can be e.g. reached
through a gateway, so it needs to be a segment-specific message
defined only at the CAN level. It must not be a OpenLCB common
message. 
</P>
<H2>OpenLCB message format</H2>
<P>OpenLCB common messages are carried in frames with a specific
value of the Frame Type field. They contain message type information
in the 10-bit variable field, and zero to eight CAN data bytes.</P>
