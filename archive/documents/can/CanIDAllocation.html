<H1>Node ID Alias Allocation Algorithm</H1>
<P>OpenLCB nodes on CAN segments do CAN arbitration by using their
unique Node ID alias (NIDa) as part of the CAN header. This page
documents a proposed algorithm for assigning unique Node ID aliases. 
</P>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>This method of assigning aliases and checking that they are unique
is necessary because of the characteristics and limitations of CAN. 
</P>
<P>Each node has 48-bit unique id, and each wants a 12-bit local
alias. Each assigns itself a potential 12-bit alias. The problem
comes in determining whether this alias is in use by another node. 
</P>
<P>If a node sends out an check message containing just the alias,
then it could expect that another node to complain if it has the same
alias. This would work, except in the (very unlikely) case where both
nodes send out the identical check message simultaneously. Neither
would recognize a conflict and both would consider that they own the
same alias. Therefore, a method needs to be found that guarantees
that the check message(s) are unique, even if they are send
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, limitations of CAN will not allow the full 48-bit
NodeID to be included in the check message. Doing so would violate
CAN rules as it could not be wholly contained in the header, and
packets with identical headers are not allowed to have differing
data-parts. 
</P>
<P>Therefore, the CIM/RIM method splits the NodeID into byte-sized
parts, sends out 4 check messages (CIM = Check Id Messages, RIM =
Reserved Id Message), each consisting of the alias and one quarter
(12 bits) of the 48 bit id. Only if all of the CIMs *do not* conflict
with another node (ie no RIM is received) does it guarantee that the
alias is not in use by another node. Even if two nodes send out the
identical packets simultaneously, at least one of these will differ
due to a differing ID-part between the two nodes. 
</P>
<H2>Requirements</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Must not require any user
	intervention. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Must be possible to map the
	assigned alias to a Node Sequence Number and vice-versa.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is not required to come up with
	the same alias every time a node or segment is powered up. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Must always converge to an alias,
	regardless of when or in what order nodes come up. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Another node watching the process
	must be able to monitor how the decision was reached and what the
	result was. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>It is desirable to detect duplicate (non-unique) NIDs, but
	100% reliable detection is not required. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2>Algorithm</H2>
<P>Start with the six-byte unique Node ID in each node, with the
bytes labelled N1 through N6. 
</P>
<P>Initialize a specific full-sequence 48bit PRNG with the 48 Node
ID. 
</P>
<P>A: 
</P>
<P>Take the next element from the PRNG . Derive the 12-bit value for
TCA, the tentative alias. If TCA is zero, repeat.</P>
<P>Start listening for CAN frames containing Check ID messages (CIMs)
and Reserved ID Messages (RIMs). A CIM consists of an extended header
with a 12 bit Source NIDa field, an 3 bit sequence field, a 12-bit
TestN field, and other bits to denote that this is a Check ID
Message. There is no other variable information in the frame. Having
NIDa, Nn and TestN in the message ensure that CAN arbitration will
work without error. An RIM is the same, except that it can be
identified as being a different message for diagnostic purposes; it
means the same thing upon receipt. 
</P>
<P>Send four CIMs with 0 through 3 in the Nn field, the 12-bit
quarters of the NodeID in the TestN field, and TCA in the Source NIDa
field. During this process, if a CIM or RIM is received that contains
the TCA value in its CI field, TCA does not belong to this node.
Repeat from (A). 
</P>
<P>Keep listening until your CAN hardware says your last CIM message
has been sent and the CAN link is idle, plus 500 msec. If you cannot
detect that condition, wait 1 second.</P>
<P>If no CIM or RIM with this TCA value in the CI field is received
before the end of the previous step, you've successfully allocated
TCA as this node's source NIDa. Send an RIM with TCA in the CI field
and go into normal operation. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>If that message fails with an error occurring during the data
	portion of the message, it's possible that two nodes have the same
	NodeID, a fatal error. To prevent the OpenLCB being taken down, this
	node should stop trying to allocate an alias and signal the error to
	the user via some non-CAN method, e.g. LEDs, emitting smoke, etc.</P>
	<LI><P>If any other error occurs, repeat from A.</P>
</UL>
<P>While in normal operation, if you receive a CIM with your source
NIDa, send a RIM, which will cause the other node to back off and try
something else. 
</P>
<P>It should not be possible to receive an RIM with your allocated
source NIDa in normal operation. If you do, log an error (on whatever
it is they log it on there) and restart the process at (A). 
</P>
<H3>Proposed alias derivation</H3>
<P>The 12 bit alias has to be derived from a 48-bit sequence number
in a way that keeps as much entropy as possible.</P>
<P>Sequentially numbered nodes will have initial seeds that differ
only in the low bits of the PRNG output. For shift-register PRNGs,
this can present a problem, as all bytes of the result are shifting
together. Combining bytes (or even 12-bit chunks) via XOR or add
operations results in reduced entropy.</P>
<P>The OpenLCB proposed PRNG (next section) uses add operations with
a constant term to avoid this problem, so treating the 48-bit PRNG
output as four 12-but values, which are then XORed, works well.</P>
<H3>Proposed PRNG</H3>
<P>The proposed 48-bit PRNG is from “A 48-Bit Pseudo-Random Number
Generator”, Heidi G. Kuehn, Communications of the ACM, Volume
4,&nbsp;Issue 8 (August 1961), pages 350-352.</P>
<P>x<SUB>i+1</SUB> = (2<SUP>9</SUP>+1) x<SUB>i</SUB> + c</P>
<P>where c = 29,741,096,258,473 or 0x1B0CA37A4BA9.The paper actually
describes a PRNG that uses signed arithmetic, but for our purposes
the 48<SUP>th</SUP> “sign” bit isn't important.</P>
<P>Note that, unlike some other PNRGs, this one can generate a zero
result, and can accept a zero seed.</P>
<H2>Discussion</H2>
<P>CAN arbitration reliably avoids collisions between frames with
unique headers. It does not guarantee arbitration between frames with
identical headers and no data; if the timing is right, they may
overlay each other such that only one frame appears to have been
sent. It is very difficult to ensure that two nodes send
initialization packets only at different times. In addition, CAN will
eventually signal an error if two packets with the same header and
different data payloads collide, but not all CAN interface hardware
provides reliable indications about why that error occurred.</P>
<P>At the highest level, this algorithm is broadcasting the complete
Node ID and tentative alias to see if any other node is checking the
same tentative alias. If two nodes have taken the same tentative
alias, at least one of the four packets used in that broadcast will
not be identical between the two nodes, because their six-byte Node
IDs are different in at least one bit. CAN will successfully
arbitrate this, and the other node will receive the frame, causing it
to back off.</P>
<P>CAN transmissions are not atomic operations; you can receive a
frame between the time you tell the hardware to send a frame and the
time that frame is actually sent. It's therefore possible for both
nodes contending for the same alias value to back off and try again.
Using the pseudo-random number generator as a sequence number makes
it likely that the next attempt will be made using different alias
values in the two nodes. <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The use of
the sequence generator also makes the arbitration process faster in
the case of sequential Node ID values. People like to use small and
sequential numbers for things, and the sequence generator maps those
to very different values that are less likely to collide during
arbitration. </SPAN>
</P>
<P>The delays at the end of the algorithm are to ensure that higher
latency nodes, such as software nodes working through USB convertors,
can reply to CID messages from nodes that come up on a working link.
OpenLCB is a soft-real-time system, and software that's interacting
with it needs to have response times of a couple hundred milliseconds
or better to be reliable. The algorithm provides a wait of a few
times that to enable those programs to take part.</P>
