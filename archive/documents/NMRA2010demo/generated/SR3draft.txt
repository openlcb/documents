   Introduction

    

   In the June issue of Scale Rails, Didrik Voss introduced readers to some of the issues involved in
   developing an accessory bus for model railroad layouts.  He outlined the history of NMRA DCC and his
   wish to develop a similar standard layout control bus (LCB), and showed the initial mandate of the NMRA
   Net Working Group which was to be used as a guide for its development.  

    

   He also described one of the proposals, S9.5, in that article.  This article picks up from there and
   describes another effort, called OpenLCB, and the NMRAnet S9.6 proposal being developed by that team.

    

    

   OpenLCB NMRAnet S9.6 Proposal

    

   To be a good value for model railroaders, a new model railroad control bus and the pieces it connects
   should be usable for 20 years or more.  DCC, for example, has been in use since the early 90's, and
   although modern parts can do many things that weren't imagined back then, early and recent DCC decoders
   and systems generally work together fine.

    

   At the same time, technology is moving forward quickly.  The microprocessors that are in DCC decoders
   today are much more powerful than the ones that were available when DCC was standardized. To have a long
   life and continue to add new features as model railroading advances, a new layout control bus should be
   able to take advantage of new technologies as they become available.

    

   Finally, we have to remember the goal:  The layout control bus exists to make it easy and cheap for a
   model railroader to get his layout to work exactly as he wants it to, without having to do a lot of
   complex things.  Only a very few of us consider complex electronics to be a big part of the hobby.  For
   most people, the most important thing a layout control bus can do is to hide all the electronic
   complexity by having the system itself handle the details for them.  DCC is an example of both success
   and failure in this respect.  It's a success, because it lets you run multiple engines independently,
   without the complexity of DC blocks, switches to route multiple DC throttles to each block, etc. At the
   same time, many modellers view the CV method of configuring locomotives as too complicated and too much
   trouble.  Programs like DecoderPro have been created by model railroaders to smooth over that
   complexity, but there are limits to what DecoderPro and its ilk can do given how DCC was defined.  A new
   layout control bus should be designed to remove those issues, and ensure it can grow while retaining
   simplicity for model railroaders.

    

   The OpenLCB team has put a lot of thought and experimentation into these hard problems, so as to create
   an integrated solution that will serve novices to experts, and small to large layouts.  We have
   concentrated on providing strong solutions in these areas:

    

    1. Simplicity for the first-time user and small layouts.  A novice can buy two S9.6 modules from
       different manufacturers, hook them together and simply teach them to interact with a few button
       pushes.  No computers or control units are needed to hook up something to control your yard throat,
       for example.

    2. Enough capability for even the biggest layouts, such as museums and large modular layout meets: A
       virtually unlimited number of S9.6 modules can be connected in various ways, including cheaper CAN
       or faster Ethernet connections, or other types to interconnect huge layouts. S9.6 ensures that
       modules can be easily interconnected without worrying about address conflicts or having to
       pre-assign addresses.

    3. Solutions when things get too full or too busy:  S9.6 lets the control bus wiring be split into
       multiple segments when large loads require it. It then automatically controls traffic flow to
       prevent bus overload, so that the model railroader doesn't have to deal with tricky configuration.

    4. Protect investment now and long term: S9.6 efficiently bridges to existing equipment so you can
       continue to benefit from your prior investments in today's DCC and other control systems.

    5. Ability to grow with new features:  Wireless devices as throttles, radio controls, and even
       unimagined new technologies will be coming to model railroading over the next twenty years. S9.6 is
       structured to permit adding completely new capabilities and protocols without interfering with
       continued use of controls that model railroaders have already installed.

    

   Key to all this are the S9.6 methods for doing this automatically, so it doesn't require the model
   railroader to learn how to do complex configuration.

    

   Simplicity, when things are new or small:

    

   S9.6 simplifies life for the novice.  The novice can simply plug nodes together, program them, and
   immediately control his accessories.  Instead of entering numbers, such as configuring a switch to turn
   on a light by loading a board with “Send 1057 on”, the user can just press a couple buttons on the light
   board, press some buttons on the board for the switch, and associate those two together permanently.
    Even complicated control of yard throats, realistic day/night lighting and other applications can be
   done without looking up numbers and complicated record-keeping.

    

   S9.6 uses the “producer/consumer” communications from the NMRA Detroit meeting of 2007. This is somewhat
   different from the method used by S9.5 and described by Di Voss in the June 2010 Scale Rails, but the
   basic idea is the same.  Changes in inputs cause “events”, which “producers” send through the S9.6 links
   to “consumers” who are listening for them.  The consumers then change the necessary outputs to turn
   lights on or off, move turnouts, or whatever else is the correct response to the event. This lets S9.6
   users concentrate on what they want to control, and not on the nitty-gritty of what messages are needed
   to do it.

    

   Device addresses area preloaded at the factory, so you don't have to configure them, keep track of them,
   or even care what they are if you don't want to. No central controller or configuration tool is needed
   to put an S9.6 system into operation, or to connect new nodes to it. Adding new controls to an existing
   system never requires reprogramming or reconfiguring of any of the existing nodes because of conflicts
   with the new hardware.

    

   Enough capability:

   As time goes on, layouts get bigger and have more things to control.  More layouts have signals
   installed these days, for example, and the signals are becoming more prototypical and complex. A control
   system has to be able to grow with the layout. S9.6 starts with a robust connection, the controller area
   network (CAN) described by Di Voss in the June article.   For larger layouts, where a single CAN link
   has been outgrown, S9.6 can connect segments together with higher-speed links.  For example, at the NMRA
   2010 meeting in Milwaukee, we showed two CAN segments connected by an Ethernet segment.

    

   S9.6 is designed to handle the special configuration needs of large modular layouts, such as those at
   annual meets of Ntrak in North America and Fremo in Europe, see the picture to the right.  Clubs' nodes
   cannot conflict, even when multiple clubs get together with modules that were programmed at home,
   because S9.6 ensures that all nodes have different serial and event numbers -- none of the modules will
   need to be re-programmed due to conflicts between their addresses.  The meet's organizers only have to
   configure any new connections and the control system is ready to go, without having to keep lists of who
   owns what module numbers, nor pre-allocate module numbers,  channels numbers, or events.  S9.6 also
   automates and simplifies the set-up and configuration of the modules, allowing the meet organizers to
   connect to and configure the individual modules, if necessary. Multiple people and computer programs can
   be simultaneously configuring and testing the layout from computers, including handhelds, all without
   interfering with each other.

    

   Solutions, when things get too full or too busy:

    

   As stated above, layouts tend to grow.  When a layout outgrows a single CAN-segment, it can be easily
   split into two segments joined by a repeater, bridge or gateway.  In addition, multiple CAN-segments can
   be interconnected by low cost gateway devices through faster Ethernet, with the gateways automatically
   controlling segment traffic by reducing unneeded transmissions between the segments.  Importantly, S9.6
   has methods to do this automatically, and saves the model railroader from having to learn how to do
   complex configuration.  

   Protect your investment:

    

   S9.6 let's you keep using your legacy equipment, such as a DCC system or other controls.  Devices called
   “intelligent bridges” can connect these to S9.6, and further integrate their devices right into the S9.6
   event protocol by including their messages inside S9.6 messages.  For example, DCC accessory commands
   are converted to S9.6 events, and they can directly address accessories attached via S9.6 without any
   extra programming.   Other buses expected to be supported are Loconet, Xpressnet, NCE's throttle bus and
    C/MRI.    

    

   Ability to grow with new features:

    

   Layouts have a habit of growing, both in extent and in complexity.  The OpenLCB team has designed S9.6
   to allow multiple computers to connect to your layout to help design, configure, debug, and if you want,
   to operate your layout.  Both wired and wireless connections, such Ethernet and WiF plus new ones in the
   future, allow directly-connected nodes such as iPhone throttles, command stations, and even virtual
   nodes implemented in software on PCs.

    

   NMRAnet Goals and Measures:

    

   The OpenLCB team has worked hard to integrate the Goals and Measures developed by the NMRAnet committee.

   How does NMRAnet S9.6 work?

    

   The OpenLCB team decided the best way to achieve the above goals was to define an extensible family of
   protocols that are based on using automatically-assigned node numbers and event numbers to ensure
   uniqueness.  These choices allowed us to achieve our priorities and (most of) the formal NMRAnet goals,
   while at the same time allowing simple nodes to remain simple and flexible.   

    

   Automatically-assigned Node Numbers

    

   Each S9.6 node has an identifying number called its ID, essentially its serial number, which is unique
   to it in the whole world.  This means that you do not need to configure an address for it, so you don't
   have to keep track of what numbers you've already used.  This number was assigned to the board during
   its manufacture, and S9.6 defines procedures to ensure that's it's unique forever. S9.6 node IDs are
   48-bit numbers, which means that a huge number of them are available and we'll never run out. Anyone who
   builds S9.6 nodes is given a large batch of serial numbers that they can assign to their nodes.  Each
   manufacturer is assigned IDs, and even you, if you want to build your own nodes, has a reserved series
   of IDs.  

    

   This is similar to the way cell phones work, for example.  They're all given unique numbers when they're
   manufactured, so that the phone companies can keep track of which one is where without ever having to
   worry about duplicate phones.  At the same time, you don't have to worry about that long serial number
   because it's entirely managed automatically by the cell phone and the system.  The phones  know how to
   talk to each other, and that's enough for you.

    

   Automatically-assigned Event Numbers

    

   The main workhorse on a S9.6 LCB is a “token”, which represents an “event” being sent from producer(s)
   to consumer(s). A token is an event ID number that is unique to that specific event (yes, unique in the
   whole world).  One or more nodes (producers) can send a token in a message, and all the nodes configured
   with the matching token will listen (consumers).  For example, two buttons on either side of a peninsula
   might set the turnouts in a station to the main line, or a occupancy detector might turn a signal red.  

    

   Configuration tools, which may built into the S9.6 nodes or as separate hardware devices or
   applications, such as JMRI, configure the token numbers to set up these control connections across the
   layout.  Unless they really want to, users don't need to worry about the specific numbers for tokens,
   because the nodes exchange them as needed to do the setup.  Again, think of a cell phone analogy:  If
   you get a call from me on your phone, you can tell the phone to remember my number from now on.  You,
   the phone user, don't have to remember 10 digit numbers since the phone has the technology to do it for
   you. You just look up somebody's name and press dial.

    

   One of the main differences between S9.6 and other systems is that it uses very big numbers for tokens:
   64-bits long.  This has some distinct technical advantages: nodes can automatically assign a unique
   event number whenever one is needed, so the user doesn't need to think one up nor record it.  Any node
   can teach its events to one or many other node(s), whether it or they be consumers or producers, in one
   teaching session.  

    

   Another advantage is we can place such things as fast-clock time, RFID numbers, and other bus's messages
   right inside S9.6 events, letting nodes respond to these just like any other event, without needing any
   extra programming to make it happen. This kind of flexibility & capacity for future growth is key to
   creating a layout control bus that will last for more than 20 years.

    

   Extensible family of protocols

    

   Because we want S9.6 to be able to grow over the next 20 years, we've structured it in terms of
   protocols for passing messages, instead of as a set of commands.  Prior model railroad control systems,
   such as DCC, define a series of very specific commands. DCC RP 9.2.1 for accessory decoders, for
   example, is written assuming that there will be four “devices” per board, each with two channels, that
   are connected together.  Although this works initially, over time new ideas for operating layouts become
   more and more difficult to fit into the box created by the original commands.

    

   Instead, S9.6 defines ways to exchange messages between devices, and then uses those to build up simple
   protocols for doing specific things. S9.6 uses events for moving small messages to any interested
   device.  S9.6 also provides “datagrams” and “streams” to carry larger amounts of information reliably
   between devices.  Datagrams can send up to 72 bytes of information between two nodes in a single
   operation.  This is enough information to build simple-yet-powerful tools for configuring nodes, moving
   RFID and radio control information, providing information on a locomotive to an advanced throttle, etc.
   Streams can send large quantities information from one node to another continuously.  These can be used
   for upgrading node firmware, uploading sound clips, or other uses that need larger amounts of
   information sent.  

    

   Currently, S9.6 has defined about a dozen ways (“protocols”) that events, datagrams and streams can be
   used to do various control operations on a layout. Additional ones can be added as needed, so that S9.6
   will be able to grow without users risking any investment, and without addition of new features being
   crippled by the constraints of past decisions.

    

   Control of size and of traffic

    

   Layouts can grow to the point where there are too many nodes or too much traffic for a single control
   cable.  S9.6 is designed to alleviate both of these problems.  The solution is to split the bus into
   segments, each of which uses a different cable.  S9.6 was designed from the ground up run efficiently on
   a segmented bus.  Its use of a large flat ID-space simplifies the problems inherent in this situation,
   without the need to extend or translate the node or event IDs.  

    

   While CAN will likely be enough for small layouts and some medium sized layouts, it's clear that a
   faster bus will be required for large layouts and in the future.  For this reason, S9.6 is also
   implemented on Ethernet, which can connect multiple CAN segments through intelligent gateways.  To help
   with traffic overload, S9.6 implements automatic analysis, filtering and routing of message traffic such
   that messages only go to nodes and segments that need them – called interest-based routing – and reduces
   segment traffic to mostly local messages only. All of this works without any changes to the basic boards
   that a beginner first starts with.

    

   Hobbyist involvement

    

   Many model railroaders aren't interested in the technological aspects of a layout control system, and
   just want to run trains in the simplest possible way.  They don't need to worry, because a lot of work
   has gone into making S9.6 as simple as it possibly can be for the model railroaders using it.

    

   At the same time, there are a few model railroaders who consider working on control system(s) a fun part
   of the hobby.  For them, the OpenLCB team has published detailed documentation for S9.6 ranging from
   descriptive examples, sample messages and example applications through formal descriptions and draft
   standards. Because we believe strongly that S9.6 should work with many different types of control
   hardware, we've published the code for running OpenLCB in both PIC and AVR microprocessors, including
   the very popular Arduino series of boards, along with an implementation for use in desktop computer
   programs such as JMRI. Our website http://www.openlcb.org contains information on how to connect up your
   prototype board, load our sample programs, and be up and running with your own S9.6 implementation to
   play with.  Like other successful open model railroad collaborations such as JMRI, we're growing a
   community of developers, users and others who will support each other and move the project forward with
   great new ideas.

    

   Conclusion:

    

   The OpenLCB team has worked hard to create a set of protocols and methods that is a step forward for
   modellers of all stripes and layouts of all sizes, while also integrating the goals, mandate, and
   measures put forth by the NMRanet committee. Special effort was made to make the NMRAnet S9.6 proposal
   robust but flexible and extendable, while being comprehensive and user-friendly.   We hope you'll join
   us by using it, and by helping us move it forward into the 21st century.
