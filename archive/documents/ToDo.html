<H1>OpenLCB™ To Do: Remaining Questions</H1>
<P>This page is a place to record OpenLCB™ issues that are still to
be resolved. This is <U>not</U> a place for recording the discussion
or decisions; once a decision is made, it should be implemented in
the documents it affects. In particular, please don't make this a
list of <U>answered</U> questions, those live in the docs we're
writing. The numbering is historical-order; please delete an item
that's done, not renumber below it, so SVN can track progress. If you
want to tag something as high-priority, please use color. Currently,
“<SPAN STYLE="background: #99ccff">blue 8</SPAN>” is
high-priority documentation tasks, and “<SPAN STYLE="background: #00ff00">light
green</SPAN>” is high-priority implementation tasks. (Feel free to
modify those color chooses, they were picked by a color-challenged
person)</P>
<P>12. First definition and implementation of “<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">train
control”, e.g. throttles, etc;</SPAN> define initial protocol. See
<A HREF="notes/LocomotiveControl.html">separate document.</A> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">DCC,
of course, but also allowing for other/future systems. Note that this
is separate from e.g. connections to LocoNet, XpressNet, etc. On MERG
hardware?</SPAN></P>
<P>17. Still need to think more about &quot;interface Event&quot;
conventions for e.g. large modular layouts. Via XML naming? Via
EventID conventions? Goal is to link next-neighbor modules easily.
Node and Event spaces for modular clubs? [task done] Let them
allocate it using ownership mechanism. Write some examples. <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">See
examples/ModularClubs.html note.</SPAN></P>
<P>18. How to get well-known Event IDs when doing in e.g. Blue/Gold
configuration?</P>
<P>20. Write an XML-based representation, e.g. as a separate wire
protocol for web services.</P>
<P>22. Signaling (Signalling) – see <A HREF="notes/Signaling.html">initial
Signaling design note</A>, which is currently just a placeholder.</P>
<P>23. Layout Sound Control 
</P>
<OL START=13>
	<P>Alex: (maybe just an adaptation to P/C Events but maybe should be
	identified at least) DPH: I think this is quite straight-forward. It
	includes complex nodes that can send and receive streams, or store
	the sounds, whether in real-time or not. The control of these should
	be straight-forward with events. Things like volume could use Events
	with data to set absolute levels, or increment and decrement Events.
	<I>(Need example doc for this application! - BobJ)</I></P>
</OL>
<P>24. Layout and Room Lighting Control DPH: Bob can probably fill us
in on this one ;-) as he has some experience with X10 and JMRI. Do we
need to do more than suggest some approaches? Maybe an application
note, showing how it could be done? <I>(Define some recommended
events for room intensity, e.g. how to code intensity in event space;
want a mechanism for events to drive specific pre-selected intensity;
study Insteon solution - BobJ)</I></P>
<P>47. Eventually, write some words about a recommended common log
format (mechanism is being developed in Logging note, but not format
of log records)</P>
<P>54. Need a CAN boot-loader/IPL process definition. May serve as a
good streaming, datagram example, but it's also possible that full
OpenLCB implementation is too much to include in a bootloader
program. “Dumbest possible node” to receive a bootload? Have a
“bootload me” standard event? “00-00” as special case.
Bootload as CAN-specific, very simple protocol? Delay is a problem,
probably has to be driven from program source, if programming more
than one device at a time. Microchip has one, see AN247; could use
that? There's an Amtel bootloader for their processors with built-in
CAN, check that protocol. Build it into same boot-loader as Arduino?
(Don GW has written a bootloader based on the Atmel CAN loader)</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">59. [Task Done] Complete the
“<A HREF="notes/DisplayProtocol.html">Display Protocol</A>” note
and a sample implementation for a display, e.g. of RF or throttle
info.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="background: #00ff00">61.
Clean up the CBUS-hardware PIC demo. Will this require reimplementing
the C/C++ prototype in C? Very little is actually class based,
struct+function might be just fine anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P>71. The examples/CrossingGateExample.html file is a funny hybrid
of general use case, and OpenLCB-specific documentation. It should
probably have the general use case aspects moved to UseCases.html,
with the specifics left in the examples/CrossingGateExample.html
file.</P>
<P>72. David Harris expressed an interest in an early email in some
standard x,y,z mapping for nodes, detectors, etc. Global and/or local
(module specific) reference frame? Make it easy to find a node in
space from it's NodeID? Is this more than just one aspect of a
general system for storing node-specific info? Is it just the
position of the node (hardware) or also items “within” the node,
e.g. the things it's connected to? Start a note....</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="background: #99ccff">75. Blue/Gold and “Event
Configuration” have been split into two documents
(examples/BlueGoldConfig.html, EventConfigurationProtocol.html).
These need to be rationalized; at least one probably needs to be a
note or even in main document area.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="background: #99ccff">78. Add definition of flags
(error, etc) in [done], stream message documents.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="background: #00ff00">83. Fast clock prototype using
events to display. (Shown several times, needs to be in SVN and
documented)(see 139)</SPAN></P>
<P>84. Add examples to the [done] and Stream protocol docs with
numerical CAN frames, to make the entire layout clear.</P>
<P>86. “Ident” protocol (item done) Prototype as part of BG
class, needs to have implementation finished up.</P>
<P>89. Finish up the <A HREF="notes/RFIDusage.html">RFID note</A>.
Prototype. David will work on this. 
</P>
<P>91. Get CAN shields made so hobbyists can use their existing
Arduino hardware? John Plocher has laid out the Railroad Shield
board. Document use of CAN shields available commercially? [task
done] LEDuino production? (Task done).</P>
<P>93. Movies to tell a story!</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="background: #99ccff">94. Document the use of
new-unique EventIDs during “factory reset” and as a way of
“deleting” an even in a producer or consumer. (See also 103)<BR>We
need to discuss this. I think we should implement a Purge which
replaces any native events in use with new native events – I am not
sure this is what is happening now. (DPH?)</SPAN></P>
<P>97. Servo example: People are starting to like servos, they're
cheap and small, so good support for them is distinguishing. Seems to
be well suited to Arduino-style hardware, P/C and our configuration
code. DPH: Lets try to get a real semaphore working – does anyone
have one?</P>
<P>99. Figure out how to do “Train Forwarding”, an application
described by Reinhard Muller at the NMRA 75 (Milwaukee) meeting.
<BR>DPH: I think this is an application layer problem. It interacts
with auto-topology. Nodes would report loco# on being occupied, and
record it from adjacent blocks' loco-reports. Display is outside our
purview. 
</P>
<P>100. Need tool in C++ prototype for sending arbitrary events
cleanly. Perhaps in PCE? Also Java, needed for JMRI.</P>
<P>101. Refactor BG to use e.g. NM for reset and PCE to send ident.</P>
<P>102. C++ prototype Configuration.cpp should use NM to reset node
number, all but node number, etc</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="background: #99ccff">103. Configuration needs a
discussion of “Setting/resetting node numbers”; also needed in
Event protocol document. (See also 94)</SPAN><BR>DPH: must redo
discussion about originated-events vs non-originated-events. When
moving a node to a new location, the node should be purged of event#s
so as not to spread them into the wild. I think this needs to be a
user controlled operation. Starting all events#=0, and generating a
new event# (originatingNID.ee) as required for teaching, sounds the
easiest way to handle this. Purging is then just zeroing out the
event#s. This does not waste untaught event#s. Working though
use-cases is useful: taking several nodes to the work-bench for set
up, and reinstalling them to the layout; selling a node; lending a
node; etc. The term “purging' seems to be useful, rather than
“reset”. BobJ: The existing spec requires that a reset of the
board assign new default EventIDs. This is about the best you can do:
If you clear the board, you get new ones. You can't build a
mechanisms that knows whether an EventID has been used or not,
because it's possible for another node to enquire about what EventIDs
the node has and starting using them without out telling the node.
“EventID == 0” doesn't work for default eventIDs, because
teach/learn need isn't the only way that you can learn about the
EventIDs in a node.</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="background: #00ff00">105. [done] so we can institute
a “daily build” process to check for broken compiles (makefile
done, daily build not; get somebody to do Hudson/Jenkins?) Consider
using the Unity+CMock or (better) the CppUTest+CppUMock test
framework for C/C++ code (Boost no longer favored for C; see
“Test-driven Development for Embedded C”, James Grenning, for
discussion) (see 160) Consider the “GoogleTest” suite of tools
for C/C++.</SPAN></P>
<P>107. Port to mbed. 
</P>
<P>109. A note regarding use of TCP/IP, UDP, etc on Ethernet,
possibly based on <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MRRLCB/message/2702">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MRRLCB/message/2702</A>,

(Mike J is working on this)</P>
<P>111. Explore whether raw Ethernet packets is a viable option,
possibly only for a one-segment OpenLCB-node only network for meets,
with other Ethernet connections through another separate Ethernet.
(low priority). (Exploration shows large drop rate) (Ed Richards
suggests investigating multicast enhancements, e.g.

– separate item?)</P>
<P>112. Consider adding “remote button push” and “remote LED
display” to make it easy to push the buttons on a node from
elsewhere. Combine with e.g. ident protocol to select the node? Makes
a simple remote programmer. See AlanHR email to OpenLCB group August
11, 2010 message 386.</P>
<P>116. Should “identify” be pulled from the full configuration
protocol and made into something light-weight? It's a separate item
in PIP now.</P>
<P>118. We have a discussion in place about developers being able to
assign node ID numbers based on whatever mechanism CBUS uses, which
removes an objection that some CBUS developers had. But this doesn't
cover the case of assigning Event ID numbers entirely, as CBUS has
multiple “event” spaces with overlapping numbering. Briefly,
they've got separate 32-bit and 16-bit event ID address spaces, with
mixed semantics, and on top of that there are modifiers for “off”
and “on”, etc. At the present time, there's little incentive for
OpenLCB to define an interface to this, but there may be in the
future.</P>
<P>119. Do a timing study on how to implement OpenLCB given the PIC
18F2480 requirement of 2msec of frozen CPU on each EEPROM write. Is
there enough buffering to keep CAN alive through that, perhaps with a
backup RAM buffer?</P>
<P>120. C/C++ prototype has some Doxygen comments, but Doxygen isn't
generating them entirely. Also, some comments are still in the older
form, particularly c.f.
prototypes/Arduino/libraries/OpenLCB/OpenLcbCanInterface.h (is that
the current file location, or a left over? Was referred to via the
Arduino web page) – This item might go away if Doxygen support is
either deprecated or moved to Netbeans support.</P>
<P>122. Should reservation be pulled from Configuration protocol and
made into a separate mix-in? (Proposal done, discussion needed)</P>
<P>123. Mike Johnson and Paul Bender have expressed interest in a
bridge to XpressNet (Lenz) protocol. JimK also working on it.</P>
<P>129. Monitor app for Android</P>
<P>135. John Plocher is thinking through the consequences of “NAT”
for UniqueIDs, notably node IDs, but also event IDs. (Consensus seems
to be that this would require some form of “DNS” to be able to
find the new/changes ID numbers for things, with all the undesirable
complexity that involves, but John is a smart guy and it's an
important question)</P>
<P>136. Where can a <U>global</U> name for a specific EventID be
stashed? This is a “find a global place from lots of local places,
while keeping it consistent” problem. Maybe stash it on each node
as “here's what I think it means”?</P>
<P>137. More fully develop the “left-both-right switch in the
middle of the CAN bus” proposal for semi-automated configuration of
a large modular layout. Can modern processors with two CAN buses help
here?</P>
<P>139. Fast clock app for iPhone (in SVN, failed App Store approval,
figure out how to do ad-hoc?)</P>
<P>141. Prompted by NMRA 2011 question, discussion of bidirectional
RF for locomotive control. Want to get info back (static and
dynamic). Standard RF technologies, but perhaps more than one? IEEE
802.14.4? Use of built in addressing?</P>
<P>142. Discussion of sizes in non-CAN implementations. (See also
145) E.g. RF that might have 128 byte (or likely smaller) frames. How
to use generic OpenLCB form, but with some limitation on length? 128
bytes allows original MTI+ID sizes (2+6+6) even for datagram in a
single frame. But what to say about other messages, particularly in
the future? Does this put constraints on general messages sizes, e.g.
guarantees for future expansion?</P>
<P>143. Simple/lightweight tools in various languages to track alias
to full node to new alias changes when a node needs to keep long term
access to an off-board node IDs. [Done], C++, iOS</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="background: #99ccff">144. The Technical Introduction
doc (TechnicalIntroduction.pdf) needs an update. It's from 2010, and
footnotes are in some cases dead links. </SPAN>
</P>
<P>147. Arduino stream prototype needs to be completed, experiment
with buffer management approaches for small nodes.</P>
<P>149. Write a Tech Note for gateway implementors. (See 140, 145,
146) (Skeleton in specs/drafts/GenGatewayTN.odt )</P>
<P>150. Write a C++ bit of code to track alias ↔ node ID mapping &amp;
demonstrate method. (See 143)</P>
<P>157. Should documents move to e.g. MediaWiki? Problem: Offline
consultation. Is there a way to e.g. PDF the entire wiki? An <U>easy</U>
offline browser? See extensions for <A HREF="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Offline">Offline
extension</A>, <A HREF="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PDF_Writer">PdfWriter</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PdfBook">PdfBook</A>.
Alex Shepherd also suggested WordPress.</P>
<P>160. Revisit the makefile build process in prototypes/C to clean
it up, separate test &amp; build. Note there are multiple independent
libraries (OpenLCB is one, Olcb* is the other) (see 105)</P>
<P>163. Update to CAN2Ethernet sketch for performance</P>
<P>166. Don G-W's point that having turnout controllers send “no
longer thrown” is a good way to turn <U>off</U> indicators on a
mimic panel. Need something like that, because lots of events can
cause the points to move away from thrown, and teaching them all to a
yard-throat panel is hard.</P>
<P>167. Define Internationalization (I8N) of CDI XML content.</P>
<P>168. Check that CDI XML is MicroXML compliant as a way to reduce
the parsing load.. See e.g.
<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-microxml1/index.html?cmp=dw&amp;cpb=dwxml&amp;ct=dwnew&amp;cr=dwnen&amp;ccy=zz&amp;csr=060112">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-microxml1/index.html?cmp=dw&amp;cpb=dwxml&amp;ct=dwnew&amp;cr=dwnen&amp;ccy=zz&amp;csr=060112</A>

and finally <A HREF="http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/MicroXML.html">http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/MicroXML.html</A></P>
<P>169. Image support in ACDI. 
</P>
<P>170. MikeJ raised some ACDI/SNII issues to address in OpenLCB
email 6/1/2012. 0x52/0x53 should be able to read just part of the
data? Memory access protocol able to find specific parts? Presence of
ACDI allows omitting that part from CDI (to save space) or with a
predefined element &lt;acdi&gt;?</P>
<P>171. Consider <A HREF="http://www.openwebfoundation.org/home">http://www.openwebfoundation.org/home</A>
approach for licensing from developers. Signing the CLA might be how
you get access to SVN, or how perhaps how you get to call yourself a
“member” or “developer”.</P>
<P>172. JSON instead of / beside XML?</P>
