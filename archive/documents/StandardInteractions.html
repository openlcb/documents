<H1>Standard Interactions</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All nodes must be able to take part in
all standard interactions.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">A) Node Initialization</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Newly functional nodes, once their
start-up is complete and they are fully operational, must send an
&quot;Initialization Complete&quot; message. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is no guarantee that any
	other node is listening for this. No reply is possible. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Nodes must not emit any other
	OpenLCB message before the “Initialization Complete” message.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Sending the IC message is required to
insure that higher-level tools are notified that they may start to
work with the node. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">After the IC message is sent, and
before any corresponding Producer/Consumer Event Report messages are
sent, the node must identify all events produced or consumed on the
board via zero or more Identify Consumers, Identify Consumed Range,
Identify Producers and Identify Produced Range messages. These are
not required to be in any particular order. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="discovery"></A>B) Duplicate Node ID
Detection</H2>
<P>OpenLCB nodes must have unique node IDs. To detect this across the
entire connected OpenLCB, all OpenLCB nodes must indicate an error if
they detect an incoming message with a Source Node ID equal to their
own. If possible, they should indicate it at the board itself using a
light or similar. If possible, they should emit a PCER message with
the “Duplicate Source ID detected” global event, which will carry
the duplicate event ID in the Source Node ID field. 
</P>
<P>After sending the “Duplicate Source ID detected” global event,
the node should not transmit any further messages until reset because
this message will be received at the other duplicate-ID node(s),
resulting in additional “Duplicate Source ID detected” global
events and causing a possible message loop.</P>
<P>To further improve the reliability of this detection, OpenLCB
nodes should, but need not, emit a Verified Node ID message every 30
to 90 seconds. As an implementation detail, it's recommended that
CAN-attached nodes use their NIDa to pick that interval so that
messages don't bunch up.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">C) Node ID Discovery</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Upon receipt of a Verify Node ID Number
message addressed to it, or an unaddressed Verify Node ID Number
message, a node will reply with an unaddressed Verified Node ID
Number. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This can be used as check that a
specific node is still reachable. When wire protocols compress the
originating and/or destination NID, this can be used to obtain the
full NID. 
</P>

error-handling scenarios defined.</P>

	sent; the node may silently ignore the incoming message.</P>
