<H1>Note: Routing Cases</H1>
<P>Not quite use cases, the following are things we considered when
designing routing, etc, for large modular layouts. 
</P>
<P>(Sent to NMRAnet_Applications 6/13/2010)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The following are some of the issues
that arise when using &quot;gateways&quot; (really, routers if they
transform the addressing of node numbers, events or similar) between
LCB CAN segments. There are several ways to handle these, of course.
One can solve them many ways: technically within the LCB design, or
by administratively requiring certain configurations, or by
reconfiguration when layouts are assembled, or just say that a
particular system doesn't do that. The various issues overlap with
each other, so they have to be solved coherently.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It would be good to know how S9.5 and
CBUS handle these. I'll post something later on about the details of
the OpenLCB/S9.6 approach.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">People might also want to add things to
the list that they'd like to be sure can be handled, or are concerned
about details of the solutions. This list comes from the use cases we
considered for OpenLCB/S9.6, but it's quite possible we've overlooked
important things. It would be good to add those to the list.</P>
<H2>Interconnection types</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Modular layouts are interconnected at
various levels. An individual modeler will build one or more modules
that are mechanically separate, but always work together. A few
modelers in a club will put together a run of maybe a dozen or two
modules that generally operate together in a group. Those groups are
put together into larger layouts at the club, meet, national and even
international level. Reasonable numbers are 1-5 modules in a person's
collection, 10-15 such grouped together, and 5 to 7 of those groups
for seasonal modular meet, for a total of 50-100 modules. Large
layouts are already 4 times that, and likely to grow.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Because there are lots of connections
between small groupings, it's desirable to have those very low cost.
Ideally, the individual modules and groups can be interconnected at
just the cost of wire by interconnecting CAN segments when they are
joined. At a higher level, modules groups of e.g. 20-30 modules could
have low-cost units doing interconnection; a large organization might
need to have 20 of these. At the highest level, units to connect the
largest segments together could be more expensive, but only a
half-dozen might be needed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As an example, FREMO modules
daisy-chain a LocoNet connection from module to module, and then use
custom modules between separate segments of the large layouts. They
also use multiple computer connections to each LocoNet segment and
inter-computer networking to move traffic around.</P>
<H2>Interface events</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Typically, joining modules will want to
exchange some fraction of P/C events at their interface. For example,
a signal system wants to know about adjacent track occupancy or the
aspect of a signal at the connection; buttons on one module might
want to align turnouts on the next one so the operator doesn't have
to move; etc. There may be a few of these for each connected module.
They need to be configured, either in advance or on the day of the
meet both in the nodes using them, and in any gateways or routers
connecting those nodes.</P>
<H2>Regional and/or overall visibility</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To run a display or control panel for a
large number of modules, perhaps even the entire layout, the LCB has
to bring a few events per module to a common point. (There are also
issues with knowing what to display, but that's a separate issue;
there are multiple ways of configuring and building displays &amp;
panels). The LCB also has to take events produced at that point and
deliver them to all the interested consumers across the layout, for
example a &quot;configure for mainline running&quot; event which
might be consumed by most of the modules.</P>
<H2>Traffic localization</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In a big modular meet, the total
traffic is likely to be large compared to what any individual segment
can handle responsively. Much of that traffic is only of interest to
small parts of the layout: The event from a button push to align a
turnout might only be interesting on that module, or might also be
interesting to a central status panel, but there are certainly parts
of the overall LCB where it's not needed; a configuration message
from computer A to node B doesn't have to appear on segments that
aren't related to A, B or their interconnect. The LCB either has to
provide enough bandwidth to carry all traffic to every point, or
provide a way of only delivering messages where they are desired.</P>
<H2>Distributed start</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Modular layouts are independently
powered: Different parts come up at different times. The remaining
system must function when parts are off, and must be able to operate
through some part being powered back on. It's undesirable to have to
reset the entire connected LCB to e.g. add a new gateway or remove
one; it's particularly undesirable to have to change configuration to
run with parts turned off.</P>
<H2>Cross-segment configuration &amp; monitoring.</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It's desirable for a computer connected
to any one segment be able to e.g. work with configuration or state
information from nodes on any other segment. One could imagine
systems that provide complete access just to the connected segment,
or that segment and it's neighbors, or any segment; the wider the
access the better. Wider connections e.g. makes it unnecessary to
move a laptop around to connect it in different places while
debugging a problem.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As a specific example, consider four
segments A, B, C, D. The segments have been interconnected in some
way. A computer on A should be able to interact with nodes on B, C,
or D without any limitations due to being on a different segment.
This may put limitations on how the segments are connected if e.g.
only adjacent segments can be addressed (the system doesn't preserve
address mapping through multiple gateways). Or it might require that
the computer know about the interconnection so as to make allowances
for it. Or some other adaptation might be needed.</P>
<H2>Gateway and router configuration</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The less that gateways and routers need
to be configured, the better. Ideally, they shouldn't require any
user configuration at all; just plug them together and off you go,
subject only to debugging of bad connections, etc. Only marginally
worse is doing local configuration: Telling the gateway or router
something about the segment that was just connected, e.g. a number
you want it called. Significantly more burdensome is having to
configure specific translations between event and/or node numbers;
there are many, many more of these.</P>
<H2>Trouble localization</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Wiring fails or is misconnected. That
just happens. While debugging, it's helpful to be able to split the
LCB at some point, e.g. by disconnecting a cable and adding
terminators, and have both segments still be able to operate locally
the same as before. This lets you connect a diagnostic tool to the
two sides, check ability to communicate, and then do a binary search
for the problem. The less configuration that tool needs before
connecting, the better. Being able to discover all nodes that are
currently reachable is helpful. Being able to find all the events
those nodes produce and consume is helpful. Being able to check error
information from those nodes is helpful. If a single segment is
split, being able to move a gateway from one half to the other is
helpful, as is being able to easily add a gateway to the half without
one.</P>
