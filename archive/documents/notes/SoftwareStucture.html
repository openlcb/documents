<H1>OpenLCB Note: On Software Structure</H1>
<P>Much of OpenLCB is based on broadcast messaging: A request for
information is sent, received by all nodes, and perhaps some of them
will reply. The protocol provides no concrete way to know when the
last answer has been received.</P>
<P>Software that works with this system should keep track of
everything that it hears, maintaining an internal model of the state
of the parts of the OpenLCB that it's interested in. As messages come
in, that model is then updated so that it's always as up-to-date as
possible. The OpenLCB protocols help this by broadcasting status
information as nodes become active, are reconfigured, etc. When a
node or program joins the network, it can send requests for the
information it needs to track. It then receives the direct responses
to build an initial model, plus additional messages later on to keep
the model up to date.</P>
<P>A model-based approach works much better than an “inquire when
you need to know” approach. If the program waits until the last
possible moment to request information that it needs, it'll still
have to wait for the replies, and it won't reliably know when the
last reply arrives. It will still need to build a model based on the
replies, but now it will be much harder to ensure that model is
complete. Sending lots of un-needed broadcast requests, along with
the associated replies, can result in significant load on the network
and nodes.</P>
