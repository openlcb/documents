<H1>Note: Signaling</H1>
<P>This document is the start of discussions on “Signaling”
(a.k.a. Signalling) in OpenLCB. Specifically, the modeling of signals
from the prototype, their operation, etc.</P>
<H2>Environment of Proposal</H2>
<H3>Requirements</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Has to be able to model signal systems worldwide.</P>
	<LI><P></P>
</UL>
<H3>Preferences</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>To largest extent possible, should be able to operate
	stand-alone (without computer), in addition to operating under
	outside control.</P>
	<LI><P>Using the JMRI notation, both “Signal Head” (color,
	appearance) and “Signal Mast” (aspect) need to be supported.
	Some users want one, some the other; ditto manufacturers.</P>
</UL>
<H3>Design Points</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Events provide a basic communication mechanism</P>
	<LI><P>“Where is the vital logic” is the key question to
	address.</P>
</UL>
<H2>Discussion</H2>
<P>See some discussion of events for signal control in the <A HREF="notes/ProducerConsumerModel.html">Event
Model</A> note, &quot;Application to Signals&quot; section.</P>
<P>This also bears on modular setup, as modules may want to control
signals across module borders. See <A HREF="../examples/ModularClubs.html">example
doc</A>. 
</P>
<P>DPH, via email: Not sure we need much here, but we do need a
model, Signals (Aspect = meaning) have one or more SignalHeads
(Appearence = physical display)</P>
<P>BobJ: We should look at software solutions and build a collection
of ideas. JMRI does it one way, RR&amp;Co another, etc, and OpenLCB
needs to be useful to all of them.</P>
