<H1>Note: Numerology</H1>
<P>A brief note on the selection of size for various fields. 
</P>
<H2>Node ID</H2>
<P>Why 48 bits for a node ID? 
</P>
<P>That's large enough to make assignment easy, while still fitting
in a CAN frame. 
</P>
<P>Larger is better for assignment, but is a load on hardware and
bandwidth. CAN networks have limited packet contents: 8 bytes plus
header. The Event ID size is NID size + 16 bits, so an increase in
the NID to e.g. 64 bits, unless the Event ID changed, would make CAN
packets difficult to form. 
</P>
<P>48-bits for NID plus 16 more to code node-specific events makes an
8-byte event ID, which CAN segments can handle (if we drop event
sequence numbers, which don't yet have a strong justification) once
we put the rest of the info into the extended header. 
</P>
<P>Ethernet MAC addresses (also known as EUI-48 addresses) are
already 48-bits long. They could be used, but we'd have to make a
node ID even longer than 48 bits to flag which are MAC addresses and
which are assigned by other means. So they're not particularly
useful.</P>
<H3>Individual Assignment</H3>
<P>Node ID ranges have been allocated for manufacturers, organization
members, etc in a <A HREF="../NidUniqueAssignment.html">separate
note</A>. We experimented with several ways to pre-assign to
individual modelers, without using e.g. a membership number from some
organization, without success.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Phone numbers are unique, but require too many digits to use
	a reasonable range, and there were privacy concerns.</P>
	<LI><P>Zip codes (postal codes) have a nice size range, but are
	certain to result in duplicate assignments.</P>
</UL>
<P>We decided that it would not be a large burden to ask people to
obtain an assigned range from a globally-visible web page.</P>
<H2>Event ID</H2>
<P>Why 64 bits for Event ID? 
</P>
<P>Event IDs are unique IDs with no internal structure, but defining
them large enough for an NID plus a 16-bit sequence number makes
unique allocation easy by piggy-backing on the NID allocation scheme.
Whoever first defines a particular event need only use a node ID
under their control (this could be the node ID of a specific piece of
hardware, but it doesn't have to be, so long as it's owned by the
person or board defining the event), plus a lower 16 bits that they
know is unique. This is then guaranteed to be unique across any
combination of OpenLCB nodes, gateways, etc, without the person/board
doing the definition having to communicate with anybody else. This
works even it parts of the OpenLCB are powered off, not yet
installed, unreachable due to a missing link, or not even built yet.</P>
<P>16 bits for event number within each NID is perhaps a little
large, but 8 bits (256 events per node) is clearly not enough. Since
a byte is a very convenient unit, we go with two bytes.</P>
<P>6-byte EventIDs do take up memory. A board with 8 outputs might
need 8*2*2 events, for a total of 200 bytes; large on the scale of
current low-cost PIC microcomputers. But this restriction is rapidly
being relaxed as new components are introduced. 
</P>
<H2>CAN ID</H2>
<P>The source CAN NID alias needs to fit completely within the header
for arbitration, along with whatever other bits are required. 
</P>
<P>The headers are 11 and 29 bits, depending on standard vs. extended
format. 
</P>
<P>The other bits that need to be included: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Priority - at least one bit needed
	to simplify bridging. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Bits for ID disambiguation - the
	default algorithm uses 8 for data plus 3 to label byte 1-6. A total
	of 48 bits (NID length) need to be checked, so fewer bits is
	possible, but it takes more messages at startup. More in header for
	this would be better. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Command code - not all needed in header, but it has to go
	somewhere and having at least part of it in the header allows
	filtering. Having a bit or two to code &quot;simple boards need to
	watch these&quot; would be particularly useful. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The longest defined payload (assuming 48 bit NID , 64 bit EventID
and 1 byte MTI on CAN) is the PCER, MTI+EventID &gt; 8 bytes, so MTI
for at least this MTI value has to be in extended header. 
</P>
<P>The use of 11-bit CAN ID (in the absense of priority bits) would
allow standard headers, but only 2047 unique nodes in the reachable
OpenLCB installation. (Routing tables would map the external NIDs to
the available CAN ID codes; the algorithm to do this would be complex
if more than one gateway was allowed to attach to a CAN segment) More
are clearly needed, and 16-bits is the next logical break point. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All this leads to an 16-bit CAN ID. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<H2>CAN Rate</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Higher bit rates move more data and
reduce latency. But they reduce segment capability in terms of
length, node count and robustness against marginal wiring.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">OpenLCB CAN frames tend to be large.
Eight-byte EventIDs and extended CAN headers combine to roughly 120
bits. (Check that!) 125kbps CAN is then about 1000 frames per second,
just a few milliseconds typical latency, and typical inter-frame time
of a millisecond.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Raising the rate to e.g. 500kbps raises
capacity to 4000 frames per second, and reduces latency by a little
more than a factor of four. But it only leaves 250 nsec inter-frame
time, which is a tougher constraint for small-processor nodes to
meet. They'll need faster processors, more advanced buffering
software, and/or more complex/expensive CAN interfaces. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The faster rate also reduces the
reliable length of a CAN segment. 125kbps is meant to operate to a
limit of 50 to 80 meters, while 500kbps should operate to 30 to 40
meters, roughly 100 feet. That still seems pretty long, but because
wiring tends to snake around layouts, it might not be adequate for
even a 25x25 foot layout.</P>
<H2>CAN Segment Size</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">What should the recommended maximum
number of nodes on a OpenLCB CAN segment? Of course, people will
always connect more, but what recommended size properly balances
reliability and robustness against the need to build large layouts?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This depends on what rate is specified,
and also on the maximum length recommended.
