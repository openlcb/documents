<H1>OpenLCB: Abbreviated Default Configuration Description
Information</H1>
<P>This is a working note in which we are developing recommendations
for “Abbreviated Configuration Description Information” (ACDI). 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There are separate documents that
discuss (a) Configuration Protocol and the full mechanisms for
Configuration Description Information. In this document, we discuss
an abbreviated form of configuration description information that is
useful for rapid retrieval of basic information from an OpenLCB node.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Consider a &quot;network browser&quot;
that can show more specific information on the nodes, e.g. their type
information, user-given names, etc. To do that, the browser could</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Read the configuration description
	information (CDI)</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Parse out the first section(s)</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do memory-access configuration
	reads to get the information.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">That last step is very fast. The
browser could do the necessary configuration reads in a small
fraction of a second, at least on an idle CAN segment. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But the first two steps are
not-so-fast. The CDI is a very powerful and general method to
describe all about the node, but it's a handful to read &amp; parse
when you just want to get some specific information.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This note discuses a code-free approach
that would allow a node implementor to say &quot;I keep my basic
information in a common place&quot;, so that e.g. browser tools can
pick that up quickly. Something like:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">1) A node denotes that it has this
capability using a specific protocol bit (1 CAN exchange to check
that)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">2) If it does, the basic information
can be found in a specific place in the configuration space
(specific, well-known address space, location, and format), so can be
directly read via configuration reads (datagram access, with small
CAN overhead)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For this to work, there needs to be a
common content (so that we don't need another layer of CDI-like stuff
to define this content too). Hence this note. What should be in that
content? 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Some fixed info:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">*) A version number, so we can extend
this later</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">*) A manufacturer name 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">*) A manufacturer-issued node type name</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">*) Node version? (Covers hardware and
software versions)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Some variable info, which the user can
change:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">*) Name</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">*) Location 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(or a more general comment field? Or
both?) These variable items don't have to be provided, but if they
are, they can be just the usual identification items that are
accessible by the full configuration protocol, configured by the user
with the full configuration protocol, but then made available for a
quick read this way.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It would be nice to keep this somewhat
compact, with the most useful (in the sense of &quot;people will want
to see this quickly&quot;) info at the front. Reading a full datagram
(64 bytes payload originally, but now less based on extended CAN)
would let us sample about 50 nodes in a second (idle bus), which is
fine. Another factor of 4 larger might start to seem slow to the
user, though. The whole idea is to be able to get a view of even
large networks faster than a user can browse through the info on an
screen. The user can then select a small number of specific nodes
that are interesting, pull the full CDI and work with the entire
configuration information of those nodes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Proposed content:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Read from space N (suggest 0xFC, right
below CDI etc)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Byte 0: ADCDI version, default 0</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Next: Manufacturer name as string</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Next: Manufacturer-issued node type
name as string</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Next: Manufacturer-defined node
version, as string</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Read from space M (suggest 0xFB, right
below CDI etc)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Byte 0: ADCDI version, default 0</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Next: User provided node name as string</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Next: User provided free-form comment
as string</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(Comment provides a longer field, not
computer parsed; node name is a short thing for e.g. headings, etc)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(String means zero terminated)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Two spaces provided for simplicity in
implementation, as we imagine that some will be from a permanent
memory and some will be user configurable.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Strings just concatenate with null
termination. A missing value is then just a null byte. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Could get in e.g. 30 character
manufacturer, 16 character node type, 8 character version into single
datagram. (This is just fixed data in memory)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Protocol ID protocol specifies whether
this is present, so no more confirmation information is needed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Later versions with higher ADCDI
version numbers could contain more fields, result in more than one
datagram in reply, etc. But for expansion purposes, they should be
proper supersets of this.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Simple Node Identification Information</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(Should this be moved to another doc?)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is a need for something for tiny
nodes, that uses a single message instead of datagrams and
configuration. This allows getting getting the information with a
bare minimum of support at the requested node end, so long as the
requesting node can be sure to handle it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Upon receipt of an addressed messages
with a SNII Request MTI, the node returns a single message with a
SNII Reply MTI carrying the information of the two types listed
above, concatenated. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">On CAN, this is done via the usual
mechanism of concatenated frames, with a short or empty one
indicating end.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Paragraphs for TN</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">this particular area is intended to be
vague and hand wavy, based on the discussions in the NMRA DCC group.
Manufacturers _don't_ want to be told what to call their nodes. They
want a place for a &quot;Manufacturer-issued node type&quot; where
they can put whatever &quot;node type&quot; name they want to. No
more normalization of that content than that is likely to succeed.
Certainly not model number; most aren't numbers but some are. Some
DCC decoders don't even have model names.
