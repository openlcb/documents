<H1 CLASS="western">Should OpenLCB Define a “Layout ID”?</H1>
<P>This note contains discussion on whether OpenLCB needs to define a
“Layout ID” for use in e.g. wireless communications. 
</P>
<P>See also the note on “<a href=""WirelessProtocol.html">Wireless Protocol</a>”.</P>
<P>Wireless communications raises several issues for OpenLCB...</P>
<P>CAN, Ethernet: Everything you can reach, you can reach. Wireless
is a little more complicated, as you can <U>choose</U> which
connection to make, resulting in being able to communicate with
different things. E.g. a wireless throttle at a convention has to be
connected to a specific OpenLCB communications infrastructure.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Two OpenLCB layouts can coexist on a single CAN segment, Ethernet,
as unique node IDs &amp; event IDs separate all meaning. Separately
configured nodes will just communicate past each other.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“Layout” is not a defined concept in OpenLCB. Nodes
communicate, and different nodes might have very different
(overlapping or non-overlapping) domains of communication. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>OpenLCB is silent on connection methods, wireless or otherwise: It
uses other, hopefully industry standard, protocols. E.g. you pick a
particular access point by name when connecting your computer, and
then you're connected to something specific.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If you have several physical layouts on the same Ethernet
and you have to reconfigure one of them, how do you tell just that
subset of nodes to reset but have the rest carry on normally? To me
this feels like a broadcast address for each layout.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But is there a global reset? Why?</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To me this kinda feels like selecting power districts at
least. What if we are able to have a group of DCC Command Stations
that auto distribute DCC addresses somehow (like FREMO does) then how
do you discover that and interact with it? … I think we will want
some notion of what nodes a layout is comprised of and provide a way
to interact with in different ways. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="margin-left: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm">This seems to
have identified a reason for a “named group of nodes” construct,
which can be used for several things besides “Layout ID”. It's
not so much a way to identify which layout to connect to, but rather
a way to deal with multiple nodes via shorthand. But what is there to
say? It's hard to design a mechanism unless there's <U>some</U> idea
of that to use it for. Events already go to all nodes who are
listening to them; streams can be sent to multiple nodes who are
interested (so far). Is this only needed to <U>force</U> a group of
nodes to pay attention?</BLOCKQUOTE>
