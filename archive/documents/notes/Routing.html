<H1>Note: Routing</H1>
<P>OpenLCB is intended to be fully routable, in that any OpenLCB
message should be able to get from any source node to any destination
node. 
</P>
<P>To reduce OpenLCB traffic on the individual OpenLCB segments, it's
useful to forward messages only to segments where nodes are listening
for them. The two ends of a gateway (or gateway-gateway link) can use
OpenLCB messages to control which common messages should be forwarded
over the link. 
</P>
<P>This note discusses some aspects of how this is done in a gateway,
based on the common messages documented elsewhere. Many different
methods are possible, and this note describes ways that things can be
done, not how they must be done.</P>
<H3>Addressed Messages</H3>
<P>Each gateway maintains a list of nodes (NIDs) that it knows are
present on the local connection, and a separate list of those NIDs
that can be reached via the remote connection. (N.B.: The
local/remote terminology is just to make the discussion easier to
follow, and doesn't effect the protocol. The protocol is symmetric
between the two sides)</P>
<P>When a node is seen on the local connection: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The remote table is checked, and
	the NID removed if present. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The NID is placed in the local table if not present. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>When a node is seen on the remote connection: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The local table is checked, and
	the NID removed if present. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The NID is placed in the remote table if not present. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Messages arriving from the remote connection are forwarded to the
local connection. (Nodes bouncing back and forth between “assigned
to local” and “assigned to remote” may indicate a routing loop;
nodes that do that just once may have been physically moved)</P>
<P>Addressed messages (with a destination Node ID) that are seen on
the local connection are checked to see where the node is located. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If it's remote, the message must
	be forwarded to the remote connection.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If it's local, the message can
	optionally be forwarded across the link or dropped. The local
	connection, e.g. CAN link or Ethernet segment, will arrange delivery
	without the involvement of the gateway.</P>
	<LI><P>If it's neither, e.g. not known, the message is forwarded,
	preceded by a &quot;Verify Node Serial Number (Addressed)&quot;
	message addressed to the same NID. This will eventually return a
	message from the node, resulting in routing table entries. Note that
	this is an unusual occurrence, which should only happen when a
	gateway comes up on an already operating OpenLCB. <I>(What's the
	utility of this? You have to forward the original message anyway, so
	that it's not lost, so what does this gain? Nothing for a
	point-to-point link, but if there are multiple remote destinations,
	e.g. a central scatter-gather, this allows the scatter to send later
	message only to the addressed node, without having to send them on
	unnecessary links)</I></P>
</UL>
<H3>Unaddressed Messages</H3>
<P>Some unaddressed messages, such as &quot;Initialization Complete&quot;,
are rare enough that there is little cost to universally routing
them. That also provides operating nodes knowledge of all the other
nodes present on the OpenLCB. 
</P>
<P>Producer/Consumer Event Reports can be numerous enough that
complete routing would be excessive. The message itself doesn't show
an destination, however. A gateway can filter PCER messages from
outgoing transmission if it knows there is no node listening at the
remote end. To determine this, when a previously-unseen P/C Event ID
occurs, it can be routed over the other-side connection followed by a
&quot;Identify Consumers&quot; message with the same P/C Event ID. If
any &quot;Consumer Identity&quot; messages come back, this PCER must
continue to be routed. If none have returned after an appropriate
time, the messages need not be routed any longer. (This is needed to
handle connecting two live networks via a gateway; adding a node to a
live network emits the “Consumer Identity/Identified” message
automatically)</P>
<P>To allow live networks to be configured to use new P/C Event IDs,
gateways need to be able to restart routing of a P/C Event ID at a
later time. The &quot;Identified Consumer&quot; message triggers
this, and node are therefore required to emit an &quot;Identify
Consmer&quot; message when they first attach to the OpenLCB or if
they are configured to consume a new Event Id. When an &quot;Identified
Consumer&quot; is received from the remote side, PCER messages with
that P/C Event ID must in the future be routed from the local side to
the remote side. 
</P>
<H3>Issues to Resolve</H3>
<P>There needs to be a standard way to command remote gateway
configuration, e.g. to set a &quot;send everything, I want to see it
all&quot;. That has to work on a IP-CAN-IP-CAN-IP multisegment link,
so has to be done with common messages. Defined eventIDs would be one
way to do this.</P>
<H2>Ranges</H2>
<P>Some devices might want to consume or produce a large number of
Event IDs. For example, a real time or fast clock might advertise
time as a range of EventIDs; a bridge to another network type
(XpressNet, LocoNet, etc) might want to send a lot of events to
represent net traffic, etc. These need to be routed, identified, etc.
This could be done with numerous “Identify Consumer” and
“Identify Producer” messages, but this would take a lot of them. 
</P>
<P>Solving this is the purpose for the “Identify Produced Range”
and “Identify Consumed Range” messages. They define a range of
EventIDs using a mask on the lower order bits of the EventID. (This
is not a general purpose mask or range system, to simplify the
necessary routing algorithms; there are well-known algorithms for
routing when a variable number of low-order bits have “don't care
values”, as this is essentially the Internet routing problem)</P>
<H2>Loops</H2>
<P>Because multiple gateways can be connected to e.g. a single CAN
segment, it's possible to create loops and other examples of
multiple-path routing. These, in turn, can create multiple copies of
OpenLCB messages unless gateways protect against this. 
</P>
<H3>Remaining Issues</H3>
<P>The routing discussion doesn't properly handle routing loops, e.g.
a TCP/IP link with both ends on the same CAN segment. Most can be
detected by seeing the same source Node ID coming from two different
links or passing onto a segment that originates that same Node ID,
but can all can be detected that way?</P>
<P>True loops, where a packet circulates around a series of links,
can't be detected this way. They require e.g. a &quot;steps taken&quot;
or &quot;steps to live&quot; field so that a gateway can detect that
the same packet has reached the gateway with different values, hence
via different routes. Or they can be detected (always? usually?) by
detecting the same unique source Node ID coming from two different
directions. 
</P>
<P>A time-to-live field would probably work for detecting routing
problems. Unfortunately, OpenLCB CAN links don't have lots of space
available to carry routing information. We need to keep the
information in the CAN packets if CAN packets can come from one link,
traverse CAN, and then go off through another gateway. How do we
transfer time-to-live across e.g. intermediate CAN segments with very
limited space? Is that required, or can we say that all CAN segments
can only have one gateway to the outside world? 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As an alternative to time-to-live, and
as a way to detect and diagnose loops, each forwarding gateway using
e.g. the binary link protocol across Ethernet could add a new
messages header (instead of replacing the old one) of node, time and
flags. One of the flags would be whether the content started with
another header, so that this could be broken apart. This still
doesn't detect loops that involve CAN segments, where these headers
are lost, so maybe it's not worth it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Alternately, verification done with
special messages, either for testing routing, or as part of gateway
initialization. We could define an “explore connection” message
and protocol to do this.</P>
