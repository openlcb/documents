<PRE>(Starting a new thread with a better subject)

Paul and Alan have raised a bunch of interesting issues associated 
with wireless connections, see below.

It sounds like now is a good time to start thinking about OpenLCB over 
wireless links, e.g. the characteristics of a &quot;wireless wire 
protocol&quot; (sorry, couldn't resist).

My initial thinking was that this would be handled where the &quot;wwp&quot; 
connects to the rest of the world. E.g. &quot;wwp nodes&quot; would talk a 
specific way among themselves, like &quot;CAN nodes&quot; talk a specific way to 
each other. Then, when information has to go to the wider world, 
there would be gateways/routers responsible for transforming wwp to 
other form(s).

(As an aside, in 30+ years working with digital communications at the 
nitty-gritty level, I've _never_ seen anything that's truly &quot;transport 
independent&quot; across more than one transport. There's always something 
that's done to adapt to another transport form, whether it be 
packetization, zero-insertion, reformatting or something else. Two 
non-identical transport mechanisms are, well, not identical, and the 
real issue is how hard/easy/automatic it is to make the transformation)

But if we want to extend OpenLCB to a transport protocol that's not 
&quot;reliable&quot; (no loss, no duplicates, no reordering), we should look at 
the implications of that. Can we handle them at the level of the wire 
protocol? Or will this force changes at higher levels?

For example, datagrams for e.g. configuration have some nice 
properties. For one, duplicates don't cause trouble for 
configuration, because each carries address, etc (they cause trouble 
for the datagram state machine, but that's not the level I'm looking 
at right now) That requires more overhead in the messages than e.g. 
send the address, then a bunch of data in separate datagrams, but it 
enables stateless code at both ends which is very nice. In the 
presence of duplication, do we need to put more emphasis on doing this 
kind of thing in all protocols?

For another example, streams rely very, very heavily on the &quot;reliable&quot; 
property. They have no internal structure to detect loss, duplication 
or reordering, nor to cope with it. I think I start to see how 
_detection_ can be added with e.g. sequence numbers, but _correction_ 
has more complex implications for buffering, especially at 
intermediate nodes. Do gateways have what they need to be able to 
handle correction of lost/missing/reordered messages in a stream? 
That needs to be carefully examined, probably simulated, and 
eventually tested.

Or is it possible to take an approach where some other, commonly 
available protocol can be layered on the wireless to just fix the 
problem? An analogy would be: when Internet Protocol (IP) doesn't 
meet the need, one uses TCP/IP instead. Is there an equivalent &quot;TCP 
for wireless&quot;?

There's some really, really interesting stuff here. Sometimes we use 
&quot;interesting&quot; to mean &quot;insanely hard&quot;, though...

&gt;&gt;&gt; We cannot consider this an error, because, for all we know, the old
&gt;&gt;&gt; next hop neighbor has gone off line (it has gone to sleep, moved out
&gt;&gt;&gt; of communication range,etc), and the network topology is adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the new node arrangement... but this leaves open the possibilty 
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; receiving a duplicate message from the network if the next hop 
&gt;&gt;&gt; neighbor
&gt;&gt;&gt; is still active.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That's going to add some excitement!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A _lot_ of OpenLCB's simplicity comes from assuming reliable
&gt;&gt; transport: No messages lost, no messages duplicated.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm at a loss for how to deal with nodes that can't be heard at all.
&gt;&gt; If e.g. a handheld throttle can't be heard, it can't control things.
&gt;&gt; About the only thing one can say is &quot;don't do that&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Since we're talking about an ad-hoc network here, which is very
&gt; beneficial to the modular railroading world, there are two problems 
&gt; that
&gt; do need to be addressed.
&gt;
&gt; The easy problem is that the node is acting as a relay node. When a 
&gt; node
&gt; like this goes offline, the network needs to re-route traffic around 
&gt; the
&gt; now missing link.
&gt;
&gt; The second case it is that a node is an endpoint. There are two
&gt; possible cases:
&gt; case 1) the node moves from one segment of the network to another.
&gt; In this case, the network topology needs to be updated to
&gt; reflect the new location.
&gt;
&gt; case 2) A node disappears and possibly re-appears later. You can
&gt; think of this as a throttle being turned off for a while (in the
&gt; sensor network world, we would say the node is sleeping - which
&gt; means at least the transceiver is turned off). While the node is
&gt; off, any packets addressed to it either needs to be stored for
&gt; later delivery (if the message must be delivered) or simply
&gt; discarded, if the application requires the nodes to be online
&gt; when the messages are sent.
&gt;
&gt; In an ad-hoc network, there's nothing to say a node can't be both a
&gt; relay and an endpoint.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Duplicated messages, particularly intermitted duplicated messages,
&gt;&gt; seem somewhat different. Certain ones won't make much difference (A
&gt;&gt; truly duplicated PCER event report isn't necessarily a disaster), but
&gt;&gt; other ones are going to seriously mess with communications state
&gt;&gt; machines and cause much trouble.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What are the usual ways of dealing with this when connecting wireless
&gt;&gt; networks?
&gt;
&gt; When this matters, we allow duplicate packets to arrive, and We use
&gt; sequence numbers to filter out duplicates in the networking stack. 
&gt; This
&gt; is true even in the embedded systems I work with (Which are mostly 
&gt; based
&gt; on IEEE 802.15.4 hardware... so the frames are limited to a maximum of
&gt; 128bytes.)
&gt;
&gt; These sequence numbers can be simple sequence numbers... i.e. the
&gt; sequence number for the next message received must be larger than the
&gt; one for the last message received....
&gt;
&gt; Though generally they are tied in with the reliable delivery 
&gt; mechanisms
&gt; somehow... in this case, acknowledgments are sent for single 
&gt; packets...
&gt; possibly on a hop by hop basis (It's cheaper from both a bandwidth and
&gt; energy perspective to retransmit over a single hop rather than over 
&gt; the
&gt; entire path...).

&gt;
&gt; On Paul's comments, my only thoughts so far are:-
&gt;
&gt; 1. Radio networks are a mystery.
&gt;
&gt; 2. They can't possibly be ignored.
&gt;
&gt; 3. Dealing with sequence numbers can't be done at CAN end points 
&gt; because the packets are too small. Sequence numbers would have to be 
&gt; added and stripped in the gateways.
&gt;
&gt; 4. There didn't ought to be any problem in passing sequence numbers 
&gt; with messages on the backbone. So perhaps the way out would be to 
&gt; include them in the generic message definitions and make special 
&gt; arrangements (again!) for CAN.

&gt; Is this another problem or just the OpenLCB over IP problem again ?
&gt;
&gt; If there are OpenLCB CAN to Ethernet gateways, and cheap wireless 
&gt; routers,
&gt; and cheap wireless internet devices (Indian goverment $35 ipad) then 
&gt; will
&gt; anybody want to design and build something completly different ?
&gt;
&gt;

&quot;Wireless&quot; means a lot of different things (1kW CW at 500 KHz 
anyone?), but I think Paul was referring to Really Low End stuff, such 
as are used in wireless sensor networks:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_sensor_network

The idea is that each itty-bitty-radio doesn't have a lot of 
communications capability, hence is cheap/light/small, but the network 
of them still provides useful communications.

It's a reasonable question as to whether e.g. wireless throttles as we 
know them will survive, as mass-produced devices may replace them. 
Perhaps people will still want dedicated throttles with knobs, perhaps 
some other solution will be found.

But I think it's a good bet that _other_ uses for itty-bitty-radio 
nodes will be found as the cost decreases. E.g., how about direct 
communications to trains via ibr nodes in place of decoders? Or 
reducing the wire burden under a layout by having ibr for control 
point boards?</PRE><H4 CLASS="western">

This was my thought, too. We package our packets inside another 
wireless protocol that handles these problems.

This brings to network topology. Should we be setting some 
restrictions on this, to simply things? Eg should there be 'leaf' 
segments? CAN segments perhaps should be leaf segments, ie only one 
connection to the 'backbone'. This would not prevent joining two CAN 
segments with a bridge/repeaters, though, as long as the other CAN 
segment was not also connected to the backbone separately.

Similarly, wireless segments perhaps should only connect at one place 
( although this might be distributed but would appear as one 
connection).</PRE><H4 CLASS="western">

Suppose a large layout with a number of CAN segments. 
A modular meet maybe, and there's a problem to fix.

Clever geezer wants to diagnose it, so he pulls his laptop, 
a crossover ethernet cable, and a CAN/ethernet gateway out of his 
bag and hooks up to his own CAN segment. 
Just like he always does back home, well within his comfort zone.

That CAN segment now has two gateways. 
Violation of the 'CAN segments must be leaf nodes' rule?</PRE>
