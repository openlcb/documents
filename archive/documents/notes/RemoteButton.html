<H1>Note: Remote Button Protocol</H1>
<P>Some OpenLCB nodes can be programmed (configured) via buttons and
LEDs on the boards. But sometimes, the board is in an inconvenient
location, so you'd like to program it remotely. This note is about a
standard way to get access to those buttons and LEDs to work from
another location. Note that the configuration protocol (link) can
also be used for remote configuration, and that provides the top-end
capabilities in this area; this is meant to provide botten-end
capabilities to compliment that.</P>
<P>This note is an early draft of a proposal in this area.</P>
<H2>Environment of Proposal</H2>
<H3>Requirements</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Allow a simple, low cost node to remotely mirror the
	button/LED UI of another simple, low cost node, thus providing
	“stoop-less” button programming.</P>

<H2>Discussion</H2>
<P>Should work with identify and ident to locate a board without
having to know the node ID number. Though ident involves pushing a
button on the node, it's still only one button. Identify can be used
to pick one of N, too.</P>
<P>Buttons and LEDs are entirely under the control of one end of the
conversation, so it makes sense to send them all every time. In turn,
that implies a datagram so that we can carry enough of those.</P>
<P>Datagrams are variable length, so there's no need for a lot of
context information to be sent: Just sent the bits as a vector.</P>
<P>Should this be a session-based protocol or not? E.g. should there
there be a start and end (so that the far end knows to set updates),
or should noes accept buttons commands and requests for the current
LED state? Requesting state requires a lot of bandwidth, because
lights blink. And there needs to be a way to say “inputs restored
to default” when you're done.</P>
<P>Is it buttons? Or inputs in general? Matters when the physical
inputs might be inputing while the remote is working.</P>
<P>Intended for indicators, e.g. LEDs, that change at visible rates
of up to 10Hz, not at 100's of Hertz.</P>
<P>Is there a need for multiple nodes accessing a single one target
at the same time? If not, is there a need for reservation? c.f.
Configuration reserveration protocol. (should that be made more
light-weight and pulled out?)</P>
<P>It would be nice to have a way to enquire about “labels” for
buttons and LEDs, so e.g. an iPhone app can make a nicer display of
the node.  Position info too, so you can show where they are on the
node board?  Getting a little heavy-weight here, but neither end
really needs to use/provide those.</P>
<H2>Base Protocol Proposal</H2>
<P>Remote node sends “start” datagram to provider node.</P>
<P>Remote node can then send “set button” datagrams, and provider
node will send “set indicator” datagrams.</P>
<P>Either node can send “end” datagram to end the interaction.</P>
<P>Datagram format:</P>
<P>Type byte: (0x21)</P>
<P>Command byte: start/button/indicator/end</P>
<P>N data bytes, each bit significant, LSB is “first” one.</P>
<H2>CAN protocol proposal</H2>
