<UL>
	<LI><P>Trains are to be treated as independent OpenLCB Nodes.</P>
	<LI><P>Train control must be independent of the underlying train

	<LI><P>Train control must be independent of train's scale, and other
	contextual factors.</P>
	<LI><P>Train control must avoid deliberately exposing the end user
	to unnecessary technical details; similarly, any model on any

	explicit configuration on the part of the user.</P>
</UL>
<H4 CLASS="western">Preferences</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P>All communication should take advantage of the Datagram
	protocol.</P>
	<LI><P>Nevertheless, because currently technology requires that
	trains be represented by OpenLCB proxies, it should be possible to
	split the responsibilities of a proxy across several physical or
	virtual Nodes, to ease implementation. Therefore, the protocol
	should depend on little (preferably no) state information as context
	for the proper processing of commands. That is, each command should
	be atomic or self-contained.</P>
	<LI><P></P>
</UL>
<H4 CLASS="western">Design Points</H4>
<P>Trains will be addressed using a well-known addressing scheme. See
TODO</P>
<P>All communications will be point-to-point, between a <EM>controller</EM>
and a <EM>train</EM>.</P>
<P>A <EM>controller</EM> is any OpenLCB Node that might need to
control a train; controllers includes hand-held cabs, computer
control systems, or decentralized control units (such as
auto-reversers for automated operation, or ATC systems).</P>
<P>A <EM>train</EM> is any model that runs on rails (i.e. is not
steerable; thus, a train might include vehicles using the Faller or
Tomix car systems). A train might be a single locomotive, a
locomotive with carriages (e.g. passenger cars with interior lighting
or markerlights that can be digitally controlled), a consist of
multiple locomotives, a multiple unit, etc. Take, for example a model
of the Usui Pass in Japan, ca. 1970. Electric multiple units that
wished to traverse the pass (either up or down) needed to be assisted
by a matched pair of EF63 electric locomotives. In this scenario,
there are several potential train objects: The EMU by itself (being
permanently consisted, the individual carriages would not count as
trains in the sense being used here), each individual EF63, the EF63s
in a paired consist, and the entire EF63+EF63+EMU consist are all
train objects.</P>
<P>The <EM>head</EM> of a train is the node with control. In the case
of a single locomotive, that train is its own head. In the case of a
consist of multiple trains, the train at the very front in the
forward direction of travel is the head.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Protocol</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">NodeIDs for Legacy Train Control Systems</H3>
<P>Train Command Stations designed to act as a bridge between an
OpenLCB network and a train control network, and hence that provides
proxy OpenLCB Nodes to stand in for Trains unable to represent
themselves, should adhere to the following schema for generating
OpenLCB NodeIDs, as existing trains are unable to generate or provide
these addresses for themselves. See OpenLCB Standard &quot;OpenLCB
Unique Identifiers&quot;, ยง5.5 for additional details.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Emergency Stop</H4>
<P>Bring the train to an immediate halt, without regard to any
physical simulation of momentum. Notice that this command is
supplementary to the more general OpenLCB commands TODO, with the
difference being primarily one of scope.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Set Train Speed</H4>
<P>The speed and direction to set is encoded as a half-precision
floating point number (aka 'float16'), with positive numbers
indicating forward direction, negative indicating reverse, and zero
indicating full (non-emergency) stop. The value specifies a speed in
scale meters per second (scale-m/s).</P>
<P>Rationale: The use of a 16-bit floating point permits relatively
precise speed commands, especially at lower speeds; such fine
granulatity ensures not just fine-grained control over the
locomotive, but helps avoid aliasing issue that arise during the
conversion to lower resolution system-specific speed commands (i.e.
DCC's 14 or 28-step commands).</P>
<P>The use of meters per second is somewhat arbitrary, and reflects
standard velocity units used throughout the metric-speaking world. By
standardizing on m/s, we avoid any future unit conversion issues.</P>
<P>The use of <EM>scale</EM> meters per second has two distinct
advantages. First, it permits us to transmit speed commands in a
scale-independent way. Second, and because of this, it reduces the
number of parameters that must be estimated when controlling a
locomotive that has not yet been speed-calibrated (which, for new
users using existing digital control systems, will be all of their
models). For example, on a DCC system, if I issue a command to
proceed at 30mph, the command station must convert the value in the
speed command from 30mph to an interger in the range [0-26] (for
28-speed-step control). The command station need only estimate what a
reasonable top speed for a locomotive might be: Let us say, 100mph.
Thus, the command station could reasonably estimate that 30mph
translates to speed step 8.</P>
<P>The alternative possibilities considered to date are absolute
speed using real units (as opposed to scale units), and relative
speed units. The difficulty with relative speed units (i.e.,
percentage of full throttle), is that TODO. The difficulty with using
real (as opposed to scale) units is that it requires the estimation
of an additional parameter for uncalibrated locomotives, specifically
the train's scale. If I issue a command to a DCC locomotive to
proceed at 0.1 (real)m/s, the command station must not only
understand what a reasonable top speed for a train is, but how to
scale the speed appropriately, as 0.1 m/s might be quite fast for Z
scale, but quite slow for G. As there is really no reasonable scale
to use as a default, users must configure their digital command
station to set the scale for either the entire layout, or on a
per-model basisโan additional configuration step that is easily
avoided by the mechanism for scale units described above.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Inquire Train Speed</H4>
<P>This is a request for a train to report its speed. Any OpenLCB
node may make inquiries about a train's state without requesting
permission first (see Security Commands below), although the train is
under no particular obligation to respond. This command takes no
additional arguments.</P>
<P>Of course, a request for a train's speed is itself ambiguous. The
controller might be interested in knowing any of a number of possible
measures: What speed the train has been commanded to take; what speed
the train is attempting to reach; what speed the train is actually
travelling at. Thus, a speed inquiry requires a parameter to indicate
the interests of the controller:</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Set Train FX</H4>
<P>Many trains offer independent control of various special effects
(FX, sometimes called &quot;functions&quot;) such as lighting or
sound. This command permits a controller to control these effects
directly. The first argument is the address of the FX to control as a
16-bit unsigned integer. This protocol does not define a semantics
for FX addresses; that is, there is no particular address that is
singled out as represenging headlights or the airhorn. Instead, the
addresses are deliberately abstract, permitting the user to decide
how to map addresses to FX for each train.</P>
<P>Additionally, each FX can take a 16-bit value. Current technology
only permits binary FX; thus 0x00 should be interpreted as &quot;off&quot;
for a binary FX, and any non-zero value as &quot;on&quot;. Analog
(non-binary) FX should treat the 16-bit value as an unsigned integer.</P>
<P>Rationale: Most digital systems offer multiple FX, each of which
is numbered. Although currently most DCC throttles only permit access
to 12 or 29 functions, DCC (TODO to my knowledge!) technically
permits as many as 32796* different binary FX (see RP-9.2.1: Function
Group One Instruction, Function Group Two Instruction, and Feature
Expansion Command Instruction especially the Binary State Control
Subcommand). For this reason, it seems prudent to go ahead and use a
16-bit value.</P>
<P>Likewise, although current DCC decoders only permit binary FX,
some (for example SoundTraxx Tsunami sound decoders) actually permit
a kind of analog control of FX by combining multiple DCC Functions.
Thus, it seems likewise prudent to permit a wide range of values, and
not simply a binary on and off.</P>
<P>One problem that faces the decision to use a single command with a
numerical FX addressing system is that any kind of standardized
assignment of FX addresses to particular FX is impossible in
practice. DCC, for example, makes no such prescription, although by
convention function F0 controls direction-sensitive headlights.
Beyond this lies only manufacturers' conventions. Thus, any kind of
mapping is best handled on a per-train basis, by configuring the
mapping between particular FX (e.g. headlights, airhorn) to FX
addresses for each train.</P>
<P>One way to mitigate this problem is to not make fixed FX address
assignments, but to map them directly onto the addressing scheme used
by the various control systems, that is, to leave each address in the
OpenLCB FX addres space uninterpreted. In this way, the default
behavior of each address will map directly onto the default behavior
of the decoder in the train, giving some degree of predictability to
the system, and permitting a digital command station the make
reasonable guesses about the possible address-to-FX mappings.
Nevertheless, users will often need to be exposed to this
implementational detail, which is deeply unfortunate, but necessary
given the ultimate flexibility of current train control systems.</P>
<P>Thus, it is recommended that the FX address space be mapped
directly to the particular control system's address space; thus DCC
F0 becomes FX address 0x0000, F1 becomes 0x0001, etc. The DCC Binary
State addresses should be mapped to 0x8000 to 0xFFFF (i.e., to the
15-bit range beginning with 0b1000.0000.0000.0000). Other systems
should be handled analogously.

Command 11110: 8 (F13-F20)<BR>Feature Expansion Command 11111: 8

more. There are just under 20bit of address space available in the
Feature Expansion Comman Instruction for the potential manipulation
of Binary State Controls.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Inquire Train FX</H4>
<P>Any node may inquire the state of a train's FX. The only argument
is the address of the FX to query.</P>
<P>Notice that, because the semantics for the FX address space may
vary from train to train, this command does not provide a useful way
to query the state of a particular FX, e.g. the headlights.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Report Train FX</H4>
<P>This command is for trains to report the state of a particular FX
in response to an Inquire FX command. The format of the parameters is
the same as for the Set Train FX command.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Email notes on use of configuration for legacy
DCC feature and CV access</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><I>Oh, I did want to mention that I
think we decided, at least tentatively, that functions would be
handled via men config protocol, andthat for nodes with addresses in
the well-known DCC range, we could use a convention where writes and
reads to a pair of memoryspaces were to be interpreted as CV
read/writes (in one space) and function updates (in the other). Did
we talk about that, or wasthat all in my head?</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We did talk about that for functions,
and I really like the idea, but I wasn't sure we agreed on it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For CVs, is the idea that we'd have a
memory space that maps straight to the decoder CV space? 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In both cases, that would allow
decoder-specific CDI (if that was available) to customize what's
presented. Like DecoderPro, the user wouldn't have to deal with CV
111, but rather with &quot;Motor multisnarb angle offset&quot; or
whatever the user-fiendish manufacturer decides to provide as
options.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There are two remaining issues. First,
is handling &quot;indexed&quot; CVs. (Ones where you write 12 to CV
51, then 8 to CV52, and then CV54 is the value you want to
read/write). QSI is the only extensive user of these, but they're
starting to appear in other places too.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There are a couple ways to handle it.
First, we could just map it as is: The configuring node would have to
explicitly do those reads and writes. But that's a mess, well outside
the OpenLCB model, and I've spent way to much time debugging weird
failures with that.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A better approach, I think, is to use
the large address space. E.g. CV 59 is found at 0x00 00 00 3B, while
the one I mentioned above is found at 0x01 00 0C 08. (The 0x01 tells
how to decode the address space, e.g. which CV the 2nd byte is
written to, which the 3rd byte is written to. We'd have to extend CDI
to carry that info, but it's within reason. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The other issue is packed CVs, e.g.
mapping parts of one or more CVs to a single &quot;variable&quot;.
This could be just a single bit in one CV, or something more
complicated split across two (like long addresses). I'm not sure how
to map those as a general case. For bits, I'd suggest another mapping
trick, where some other part of the space is actually bit mapped:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">0xFF 00 53 3C</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">is the middle bits (the 3C mask) of CV
53, and the 0xFF is just an arbitrary key for this. That doesn't work
with noncontiguous splits across generic CVs, though, as that takes a
lot to configure.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(And don't get me started on CV1/CV29
sequencing; I think we just ignore that entirely at the CDI level &amp;
build it into the gateway to DCC)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the end, these legacy pains can't
really be avoided. We have to croft the OpenLCB protocols to do a
reasonable job with them, but I don't think we have to go nearly as
far into the weird special cases as e.g. DecoderPro does.</P>
