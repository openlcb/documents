<H1>Note: RFID and OpenLCB</H1>
<P>More and more model railroaders are becoming interested in using
RFID techniques on their railroads, typically to identify rolling
stock. The <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RFID4MRR/">RFID4MRR
Yahoo group</A> contains ongoing work on this.</P>
<H2>Environment of Proposal</H2>
<H3>Requirements</H3>
<P>Must be extensible to multiple kinds of RFID tags, including ones
with large amounts of information. Implementation must not require a
specific kind of reader.</P>
<P>Must allow more than one RFID reader on a node.</P>
<H3>Preferences</H3>
<P>Efficient protocol for multiple consumers of RFID information.</P>
<P>Some way of keying standard consumers that an RFID read has
occurred, so they can e.g. show a light or trigger some other
process.</P>
<P>More than one reader on the layout implies that location
information is needed with the results of the read. Messages contain
their source <U>node</U>, but that's not the entire identification of
their source <U>reader</U>.</P>
<H3>Design Points</H3>
<P>Uses global event to advertise that a node will be providing
information from one or more RFID units.</P>
<P>Use a node-specific event to indicate that a reader has read
information.  One such event per attached reader.  Interested
consumers could then act, either on that or by doing a datagram read
for the RFID information itself.</P>
<P>Need to signal failed reads?</P>
<P>Provide a way to register to receive datagrams of RFID information
when reads occur.</P>

<H3>A discussion</H3>
<P>Notes from an email discussion in November 2009 about use of RFID
tags with OpenLCB.</P>
<H4>Mike Johnson</H4>
<P>My next question is about RFID tags, the 64 bit tags have 40 bits
of data. The EM4102 spec seems to have a 32 bit global unique number
plus an 8 bit version/user code. So it seems that a minimum size for
an event would be 6 byte NID + 4 bytes of tag. (Pity the NID was not
4 bytes, so it could all fit in one packet as an 8 byte event). 
</P>
<P>I'm thinking that it would be nice if the RFID tag event could be
used like any other event to select a route for a train or turn on an
LED. 
</P>
<P>But, an RFID reader can only send the tag, with the NIDa in the
header needing to be translated to a full NID by a consumer. Perhaps
translating an RFID tag event to a normal event needs to be done by a
larger node or PC. Have RFID tags been considered ? 
</P>
<H4>David Harris</H4>
<P>Well, we could allocate a unique Event# range to EM4102 tags, by
assigning the top three bytes a unique number, and leaving the bottom
5-bytes for the EM4102 40-bit GUID. Then the event# derived from each
tag would be guaranteed to be globally unique within OpenLCB. Even
better, if we only need 32-bits from the<BR>tag-GUID. 
</P>
<P>[ Event#s are required to be globally unique. Constructing an
Event# from a (globally unique) NID is only one way to ensure global
uniqueness. ]<BR><BR>I expect other tags will need other prefix bytes
to make them unique. (We may not be able to support a large number of
different tags.) 
</P>
<P>Using a tag-id as an event is useful for the blue/gold
programming, too, as a tag could be directly associated with some
consumer actions. 
</P>
<H4>Bob Jacobsen</H4>
<P>There's a brief mention of them in the Datagram doc:
&lt;<A HREF="http://openlcb.sourceforge.net/trunk/documents/DatagramProtocol.html">http://openlcb.sourceforge.net/trunk/documents/DatagramProtocol.html</A>&gt;
</P>
<P>The idea there was that they'd be sending information from a point
to a point, e.g. reporting to a central yard processor as a train
arrives, so a datagram was fine. 
</P>
<P>If one wants to put both tag and location in a single 8 byte
event, you certainly can, you just can't use the node ID to do it. So
how to allocate the 64-40 or 64-32 other bits? 
</P>
<P>Since the source NodeID is carried _separately_ from the EventID
in every produced-event message, one approach would be to define a
unique upper 24 or 32 bits for &quot;RFID Event&quot;, and then key
location to the source NodeID (reserving that much space for
well-known events is easy, since you're really only reserving a small
part of it). You could even allocate a little more space if desired,
e.g. for an extra couple of status bits, but you can't go too far
that way.
