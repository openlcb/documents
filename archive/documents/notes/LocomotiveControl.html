<H1>OpenLCB Note: Locomotive Control</H1>
<P>Locomotive control is traditionally the domain of DCC in the NMRA.
OpenLCB will likely need to eventually take part, and this note is a
place to put some of the discussion now taking place.</P>
<H2>Environment of Proposal</H2>
<H3>Requirements</H3>
<P>Not just DCC, but also other existing and future systems.</P>
<P>Provide large address space for locating locomotives.</P>
<P>Simple “big knob” throttles through full-capability iPhones.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A throttle attached to any segment
should be able to control a train anywhere. 
</P>
<H3>Preferences</H3>
<P>Efficient on CAN.</P>
<P>Must be able to query throttle capabilities, e.g. ability to
display information.</P>
<P>Must work well with multiple forms of wireless.</P>
<P>Nodes may have little compute power; simple nodes must be able to
use pre-formatted messages for most things.</P>
<P>Cleanly handle the need for multiple command stations.</P>
<P>It should be possible to hand a running train off from one
throttle to another.</P>
<P>A throttle node can control more than one locomotive at a time via
some form of “sub-throttle”, e.g. “right knob” and “left
knob”. Might be physical, might be just virtual e.g. switch back
and forth via button.</P>
<P>Throttles need to be able to retrieve roster information (name,
perhaps description and picture?) in addition to talking to control
system. Might not come from the same place!</P>
<H3>Design Points</H3>
<P>Use events for global communication, but mostly exchange
point-to-point datagrams. A large series of unique node IDs has been
reserved for each control system for this purpose.</P>
<P>Use “throttle” and “command station” metaphors, at least
for start.</P>
<P>Throttles could be either a physical handheld or computer program.</P>
<P>The separate <A HREF="DisplayProtocol.html">display protocol</A>
can be used to drive displays on the throttle once it's identified. 
</P>
<P>A node may have multiple “throttles” in it, e.g. two in a
hand-held. Need to be able to specify which when talking to and from
the throttle, e.g. need to have a way to identify a specific
“throttle” in the node with a specific display.</P>
<H2>Proposed Protocol</H2>
<P>Throttles locate the command station (controllers) currently
servicing a locomotive (or other addressable unit) by emitting an
event in the OpenLCB-reserved space. Four bytes are reserved to
identify which one, which could be e.g. two bytes of system prefix
and two bytes of DCC address, or something else; see below. All
command stations (controllers) receive this, as it's a true global
message. The node making the request is identified by the source of
the message. (Note that the throttle within the node is not, and
there will have to be enough information in replies to match up
returning information with the request) The one(s) controlling the
locomotive reply to the throttle via datagram with identification and
status information. Nodes with roster information also proffer
information via datagram. The point-to-point connection has then been
made.</P>
<P>Datagrams flow between the throttle node and CS node to control
the train. Because both throttles and CSs can control multiple
trains, the datagrams contain a “session ID” that was negotiated
at the start. This doesn't have to have any meaning, though of course
the two ends can use it for their own internal purposes. 
</P>
<H3>Examples</H3>
<H4>Simple Acquisition</H4>
<P>Node T wishes to open throttle connection, sends event message
with (OpenLCB Prefix – 3 bytes)(Locate Controller – 1
byte)(Locomotive ID – 4 bytes)</P>
<P>Command station C sends datagram to Throttle T with (throttle
command – 1 byte)(Locomotive ID – 4 bytes)(Op: Located – 1
byte) (Status, nominally two bytes)</P>
<P>Note T sends reservation request to C, which prevents deadlock and
allocation holes by using test-and-set operations; results in a
two-byte ID assigned to this communication by CS; could be slot
number or anything else, throttle&amp;CS just use for rendezvous
during interchange. 
</P>
<P>Throttle T sends single-frame datagrams with speed, functions as
needed; 5 byte payload in 1<SUP>st</SUP> frame if Type, ID present,
allowing a command byte and speed, with some functions. Might still
want to separate speed and function.</P>
<P>Command station C returns status datagrams as needed</P>
<H4>Transfer command station</H4>
<P>A train is being controlled by Throttle T with command station C1.
The train is about to leave C1's control. Assume that C1 is aware of
this, and knows that C2 will be able to control it. (Does T need to
send speed commands to both C1 and C2 for a while? e.g. do they
really know where the edge is?)</P>
<P>C1 sends a “transfer” datagram to T informing T of this, which
carries C2's address. 
</P>
<P>Alternately, C1 sends a “please reacquire” datagram to T,
telling T that control is about to be lost. T goes through the simple
acquisition operation, this time getting communications from C2.</P>
<H3>Datagram Format</H3>
<P>Basic format is datagram-ID-byte, one byte session ID, then a
command byte for throttle-CS communication, then arguments. Five
bytes of arguments fit in the first CAN frame.</P>

<H4>Throttle to Command Station</H4>
<P>Commands:</P>
<P>Set speed – what's the appropriate range? 0-255 probably not
enough steps for the long run. Fit a couple more bits in? 16 bits too
large? 15, using one for sign?</P>
<P>Set functions/outputs – There are multiple function spaces
available, e.g. DCC NMRA now has <U>three</U> overlapping function
address spaces, perhaps more if you count consisting. Bit mask is
convenient for some things, but most option operations are just one
change. Include a duration code for precise timing? Then sequences
for sounds? Then what? If use bit mask, how many? 0-28 fits in four
bytes, which is available. Any systems have more than that? Is CAN
fast enough that two consecutive commands to change two things at the
same time doesn't introduce too much skew?</P>
<P>Allocation commands – release, allow dual use, etc. 
</P>
<P>Get status: Read back everything the command station knows.</P>
<P>Get info: For e.g. roster information. Might have to go to some
other node than CS, e.g. a separate computer.</P>
<P>Need protocol for handing off to next command station, which can
be initiated either by new CS or old one. Is that a CS-CS
communication, with the throttle being told at the end, or does the
throttle initiate it when told “I can't control this any more, find
somebody who can”?</P>
<H4>Command Station to Throttle</H4>
<P>Commands:</P>
<P>Must transfer to another; Transfer to CS node N</P>
<P>Get throttle properties: enquire about display, etc.</P>
<H2>Remaining Points</H2>
<P>What is the unit of addressability? A “locomotive”, a
“decoder”, a “consist” or what? Does that vary per system?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">Alex, via email: Although explicitly
excluded from our initial work I think we should have some place
holders for this at a high level. Needs to include: - DCC - DC -
Multi-Block DC (MERG SuperBloc, QuadThrottleUnit etc) - Wireless
direct to Locos - Other?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">DPH: Yes, I started to list
possibilities, but they seem endless: (1) One block/one CS/ one
booster: DC, DCC, PWM DC (2) Multi- block/CS/booster (3) direct RF
control Perhaps our model should look like Throttle &lt;---&gt; Loco.
Whether that is really: (a) Throttle-RF &lt;--&gt; RF-receiver &lt;--&gt;
CS-service &lt;--&gt; aBooster ---&gt; Track --&gt; Loco-decoder
&lt;---&gt; BOD &lt;---&gt; Throttle or just: (b) Throttle-RF &lt;--&gt;
Loco-RF-decoder ; GPS&lt;--&gt;Throttle All the in-between bits are
hidden from the user - but not unfortunately, from us. 
</P>
<P>Should users have to know what they're addressing in detail, e.g.
“Locomotive 12345 on the TCS system”? Or just “Locomotive
12345” and have system locate? (Note number of digits; four is not
enough!)</P>
<P>How can a command station attach a specific locomotive to a
throttle? To a control point within a throttle (“left knob”)?
Very useful in some applications to be able to do that centrally.</P>
<P>To what extent does consisting need to be explicitly handled?</P>
<H3>Control Systems:</H3>
<P>A list, to try to remember the options, in no particular order:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>DC (controlled in various ways, e.g. MERG system) &amp; AC;
	analog</P>
	<LI><P>DCC</P>
	<LI><P>TMCC (Lionel)</P>
	<LI><P>Maerklin/Motorola (multiple systems?)</P>
	<LI><P>DCS from Mike's Train House (MTH)</P>
	<LI><P>(Future) Direct communications e.g. RF link to locomotive</P>
</UL>
<H3>Items from DPH email May 24, 2010:</H3>
<P>1. Messages are between a throttle and a train. In the future
messages will likely be send directly from throttle to train, via RF.
It is the job of today's CS, perhaps with the help of a helper-node,
to model a train as a fully functioning pseudo-node. Messaging will
use directed messages, or Datagrams, but, could use bidirectional
streams. This interchange is really between the throttle and the CS,
but conceptually and in appearance to the user, it should appear to
be between the throttle and the train. 
</P>
<P>2. In large layouts with more than one command station (CS), each
CS will have a defined territory and associated DCC stream. When a
train crosses two territories, there must be automatic hand-off of
the train from one CS to the next. An block-occupation event will
announce a train 'crossing the frontier'. The receiving CS will
negotiate with the first for the train's NID, direction, speed,
acceleration, functional state, etc.</P>
<P>3. Two CSs cannot drive the same block, nor two adjacent blocks
with an engine bridging them, with their differing DCC streams. This
requires a special intervening block between the two CSs'
territories, which is switched between the two DCC streams. To
prevent more than one train entering the shared block, signaling and
speed control is used. This may fail with the simultaneous arrival of
two trains, and two additional short, protective, blocks may be
necessary to this. These can use 'Bit-switch'-like techniques to halt
oncoming trains. This has been done by the Freemo group in Europe,
see: <A HREF="http://dcc-mueller.de/switch/loconete.htm">http://dcc-mueller.de/switch/loconete.htm</A></P>
<P>4. Despite the train's movement, its NID is fixed, just like any
node. Each engine can be assigned a unique 48-bit NID by its
manufacturer, a user, or perhaps constructed from a RFID tag number.
Using the user's space would allow the lower 16-bits to equal the
engine's road number, which would simplify display without
translation tables. 
</P>
<P>5. Each train also has a NID. This can be assigned from the lead
engines NID, but it would be nice if the bottom digits represented
the train number as some of these have historical significance.
Therefore, the NID prefix could be derived from the layout ID, the
meet's range, or a fixed number denoting 'Train'. Train NIDs would
then have the form TRAIN.x, where x is 0-65k, and TRAIN is a fixed
48-bit number.</P>
<H3>Controlling turnouts from a throttle</H3>
<P>E.g. LocoNet throttles let you send a message “change turnout
23” to the DCC system. How to do that in OpenLCB?</P>
<P>First, people don't want to enter the actual address of a turnout
on a their throttle; they want to enter some useful number.  LocoNet
has an entire mechanism in place to do that, but it's such a pain to
set up that almost nobody uses it (Bushby bit).   Right way to do it
is to teach the throttle a set of useful names for the things it
wants to address, e.g. by downloading a list of names that can be
scrolled through. WiThrottle does this by downloading the JMRI user
names into the iPhone/Android for selection by the user. Need a
protocol for that.</P>
<P>For a really simple throttle, e.g. PIC-based, the best approach
might be to do this in some central node that supports the IT (idiot
throttle) and does any needed translation.</P>
