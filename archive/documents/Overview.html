<H1>OpenLCB Overview</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Introduction</H2>
<P>OpenLCB defines a family of interoperating protocols for
controlling model railroads. It is structured around some common
concepts and separate implementations. 
</P>
<P>The OpenLCB will be capable of supporting Accessory Control,
Advanced Locomotive Control and even Multimedia and Rich Text
features on the higher bandwidth networks. This protocol proposal
will focus on OpenLCB Accessory Control with emphasis on CAN 2.0B but
allowance has to be made for simple Locomotive Control and
implementation of the OpenLCB protocol on other network technologies
like Ethernet, Internet and others. 
</P>
<P>This proposal is based on a series of <A HREF="UseCases.html">use
cases</A> that extend from a beginning modeller connecting up two
boards to a huge modular layout put together by several clubs. To
achieve this range, and to allow for future technologies, OpenLCB is
defined so that it can communicate over CAN segments, within
computers, and on network links. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Key Features of This OpenLCB Protocol Proposal</H2>
<P>The key features of this proposal are: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The basic communicating unit is
	called a &quot;Node&quot;. A node might be a single board, or a
	single program in a PC, or any other addressable item. A node may
	control any number of actual devices on a layout. Nodes exchange
	messages to control the layout. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Every node has a &quot;Node ID
	number&quot; (NID). The assignment of the NIDs assures they are
	globally unique. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For controlling the layout,
	OpenLCB defines how to transport several basic types of data between
	nodes: 
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Events - Fixed length identifiers
		that can propagate from multiple source nodes to multiple
		destination nodes. These are typically used to announce that
		something of interest has happened on the layouts so that
		controlled devices can respond.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Datagrams – Move up to 70 bytes
		efficiently from a source node to a specific target node.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Streams - An efficient way to
		move a large, variable number of bytes from one node to another. 
		</P>
	</UL>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is also provision for
	interconnection of independent OpenLCB segments and filtering of
	messages to reduce traffic. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To do this, OpenLCB defines a
	global set of common message types and their content. OpenLCB
	specifies how the common message types are to be used for standard
	interactions and optional interactions. All OpenLCB nodes must be
	able to properly take part in standard interactions that are
	originated from outside the node. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The format of the common messages
	is separately specified for each of several wire protocols. The
	initial wire protocols are CAN and TCP/IP point-to-point; additional
	ones such as radio links are envisaged. OpenLCB wire protocols may
	define additional interactions and messages for specific
	transport-level uses on a particular type of connection, e.g. for
	housekeeping on the local connection. These interactions and
	messages are divided into standard forms, which all nodes must
	implement, and optional forms. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The OpenLCB as a whole consists of
	one or more OpenLCB segments interconnected with bridge devices that
	ensure all nodes are able to communicate equally with all other
	nodes on the OpenLCB. All OpenLCB nodes see all OpenLCB messages
	relevant to them. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is no hierarchy of nodes or
	node aggregation or tree structures or segmentation that necessarily
	filters OpenLCB traffic. The OpenLCB is a flat structure where all
	nodes are equally accessible and addressable. At the same time,
	there is provision for gateways to acquire routing and filtering
	information so that messages can be efficiently delivered.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All OpenLCB nodes identify the
	messages they send with their unique Node ID number. Any OpenLCB
	message can be traced back to the originator using the Source Node
	ID. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3 CLASS="western">CAN Implementation</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">An OpenLCB Node ID is unique, but
	too large to carry in a CAN header. Therefore OpenLCB dynamically
	creates a segment-unique &quot;Node ID alias&quot;, which then
	provides the necessary uniqueness to the CAN Arbitration Header to
	ensure reliable collision avoidance. No other form of e.g. priority
	bits is required to assist with arbitration of messages to avoid
	possibly ambiguous or non-unique CAN Header bit patterns. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Where a point to point or directed
	OpenLCB message needs to be sent to a specific node the Destination
	ID field is placed in the CAN Data portion of the CAN Frame in the
	shorter &quot;alias&quot; form. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">No central Network Manager is
	required, either globally or on a segment. Global network monitoring
	and diagnostics can be provided if desired.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">CAN masks/filters can still be
	applied to identify frames directed to a node, along with the
	relevant globally-addressed messages.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Event data is placed in the CAN
	Data portion of the CAN Frame. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Stream data can transfer up to 8
	bytes of data per CAN Frame and a single node can source as many
	streams as desired, but there can only be one stream on CAN at a
	time between a specific source and destination node.</P>
</UL>
<H3 CLASS="western">Design Considerations</H3>
<P>Networking technologies come and go and new ones become dominant.
Due consideration needs to be given to the possibility that the
current popular networking technologies of CAN and Ethernet may be
eclipsed in the future by emerging technologies like Wireless
802.15.4, FlexRay and others. The OpenLCB protocol design should
ensure that OpenLCB will perform adequately on common CAN and
Ethernet (including WiFi) networking technologies, but not at the
expense of limiting its adaptation to other networking technologies,
including ones not considered now. 
</P>
<P>A critical design consideration is to allow for the addition of
newer technologies without having to discard the older technologies.
OpenLCB must be able to seamlessly add new network segments without
having to reconfigure the whole OpenLCB to accommodate the change.
Node numbers, event IDs and similar things must be portable across
the network so that topology changes are accommodated without
requiring major reconfiguration. 
</P>
<P>A significant design consideration for the OpenLCB has to be ease
of use for non-technical users and provision of Plug-N-Play type
features including automatic discovery and user friendly
configuration tools to assist with OpenLCB setup and configuration.
Also OpenLCB needs to support gathering of network performance
statistics to assist with performance tuning, identifying the
cause(s) of faults and performance problems. 
</P>
<P>The OpenLCB must be able to start small and grow over time as
layouts evolve. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">OpenLCB Network Topology</H3>
<P>OpenLCB is built on top of a reliable transport. This can be
either point-to-point, or multipoint. “Reliable” transport
delivers all messages between two nodes, without changes, deletions,
duplications, additions or re-orderings. No assumptions are made
about the order of communications between different nodes or node
pairs. (The OpenLCB CAN format has been designed to allow for CAN
network behavior, where low priority messages may be delivered behind
higher priority messages)</P>
<P>A layout with a OpenLCB will require at least one OpenLCB network
segment. This could be CAN, Wireless, Ethernet or WiFi, but is likely
a combination of several technologies. A layout may have a lengthy
CAN based OpenLCB segment with many nodes running around the entire
layout and have a comparatively short Ethernet segment or backbone
segment that provides a convenient connection to a single PC. It is
likely that entry level OpenLCB compatible DCC Command Stations will
just have a CAN OpenLCB interface and a USB PC interface. Medium
level DCC Command Stations might add Ethernet and Wireless interfaces
whereas top end DCC Command Stations may also add WiFi. It is also
likely that manufacturers will provide various interface devices to
bridge between each of the OpenLCB segment types like CAN to
Ethernet, CAN to USB (for PC access), CAN to Wireless and Ethernet to
Wireless (for wireless throttles). Bridges to WiFi are likely to be
using consumer grade Ethernet to WiFi Access Points but some markets
may opt for a WiFi interface in the DCC Command Station. 
</P>
<P>Each segment of a OpenLCB is by default transparently connected to
all other segments. A single CAN cable would be a OpenLCB segment, as
would two CAN cables connected by a repeater. An Ethernet link would
also be a segment, as would TCP/IP network connections. 
</P>
<P>Two or more segments can be connected by bridge devices. Simple
bridge devices do not filter any messages: all messages are forwarded
to all other segments. More intelligent interconnection devices can
reduce required bandwidth by filtering messsages that are not needed
on the far side of the bridge; these are called gateways. 
</P>
<P>As an example, a CAN segment with a number of nodes can be
connected via a CAN-USB or CAN-Ethernet bridge to a PC running
several seprate control programs. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As another example, a CAN segment in a
series of modules can be connected via a bridge to an Ethernet
backbone, which in turn connects via several other bridges to
separate CAN segments in other collections of modules. Several PCs
can be connected via the Ethernet and interact with all the modules
via the individual CAN segments.
