<H1>NMRAnet selection and acceptance tests</H1>
<P>The NMRA has defined criteria that an NMRAnet proposal must meet. 
Those can be found in two documents:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><A HREF="NMRAGoalsAndMandate.pdf">NMRAGoalsAndMandate.pdf</A></P>
	<LI><P><A HREF="NMRANetGoalsAndMeasures-2007-10-22.pdf">NMRANetGoalsAndMeasures-2007-10-22.pdf</A></P>
</UL>
<P>In addition, the members of the working groups have had ongoing
discussions about usability, use cases, etc.  See for example the
S9.6 use document.</P>
<P>No decision has been made about the NMRAnet process for adopting
one or more proposals, but the working group members hope that heavy
weight will be given to how well the proposal meets these criteria. 
In an attempt to reach consensus on that, if not which criteria are
more important, we will be creating documents and Wiki pages for each
proposal to track how well they do on each of these items.</P>
