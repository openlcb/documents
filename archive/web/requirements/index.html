The NMRA has provided two documents on acceptance criteria:
 * [http://nmranet.sourceforge.net/NMRAGoalsAndMandate.pdf Goals and Mandate]
 * [http://nmranet.sourceforge.net/NMRANetGoalsAndMeasures-2007-10-22.pdf Goals and Measures]

The S9.6 developers have suggested a number of use cases (link to be provided).

On the rest of this page, we list the individual "Goals and Measures", along with links to individual pages where developers can comment on how their proposal fares on each item.  

These goals and measured were initially documented by John Socha-Leialoha, with input from David Harris and others on the NMRAnetWG egroup, and were transcribed form an official document from that working group.  

''Goals are meant to provide a shared vision of what we're trying to achieve.  As such, they describe what we want to support without necessarily restricting other approaches.  Well-written goals help make decisions.  When you have a problem you're trying to solve and you have multiple solutions you could choose from, goals help point the way to solutions that further the shared vision.  As such, goals do not use strong words like shall and should with a "legal" intent, which often dictate solutions too early in the process. Rather, these words carry no special meaning. (Note, I'm carefully avoiding defining what words we should use because these goals are not meant to be a rigid framework-just aspirations).  ''  

''Additionally, these goals are intentionally brief. They're designed to be easy to read and re-read as a guide to our work. Clarification is in the Measures of Success section, which has much longer descriptions.'' --John Socha-Leialoha 
  

----
=== Interoperability ===

''Goal:'' Products from one company can work with products from any other company, and with legacy systems.

''Measure:'' Manufacturers can easily test their nodes for interoperability using standard tests. 
Any device passing these tests should be able to work with other devices passing these tests. 
Likewise, it should be easy for manufacturers to build bridges to systems like DCC or Loconet that 
allows NMRAnet turnouts to be controlled from DCC throttles, and DCC engines/accessories to be 
controlled from NRMAnet. 

(See [wiki:GaM/Interoperability related detail page].)
----
=== No Central Control ===

''Goal:'' Products can interact with other products without the need for a central 
processor. 

''Measure:'' Once a layout is set up, it should run perfectly and completely without a 
central processing system for basic and advanced functionality. 


(See [wiki:GaM/NoCentral related detail page].)
----
=== Optional PC Control === 

''Goal:'' A PC can provide higher-level functionality, such as a CTC Interlocking, 
and system functions such as monitoring, testing, and debugging. 

''Measure:'' A computer attached to the bus can provide more advanced functionality, 
such as CTC, and system-control functions such as: monitoring, testing and debugging  


(See [wiki:GaM/OptionalPC related detail page].)
----
=== Simple ===

''Goal:'' Make it easy for a novice customers to install and configure without 
technical knowledge (should be easier than DCC systems).  

''Measure:'' A customer can change the configuration of any device at any time with a simple interface 
that includes text descriptions of settings, thus greatly reducing the need for a manual and required 
level of learned expertise. This mechanism should also reduce the support burden to the manufacturer. In addition:

* You can disconnect a node, reconnect it somewhere else on the same net and have is still work without having to make any configuration changes. 

(See [wiki:GaM/Simple related detail page].)
----
=== Expandable ===

''Goal:'' Allow very large layouts (a higher-level of technical knowledge required is 
OK for large layouts). 

''Measure:'' A very large museum layout might be divided into distinct segments that work 
together as a single network. You can use a device, such as a hub, repeater, or switch, to connect 
multiple segments to form a single network.

(See [wiki:GaM/Expandable related detail page].)
----
=== Flexible ===

''Goal:'' Customers can easily connect many-to-many devices, and connect to legacy 
systems. 

''Measure:'' You can buy devices from any manufacturer that were designed without knowledge of the other devices and make them work together.  

(See [wiki:GaM/Flexible related detail page].)
---- 
=== Extensible ===

''Goal:'' Allow additional functionality to be added easily, whether by the NMRA, or 
manufacturers. 

''Measure:'' The NMRA can add Standards and/or RPs on top of the bus to define new capabilities. 
Additionally, manufacturers can add their own proprietary functionally between their own devices.

(See [wiki:GaM/Extensible related detail page].)
----
=== Easy to Implement ===

''Goal:'' Easy and inexpensive to implement products that are reliable and 
compatible for vendors wishing to create products. 

''Measure:'' A manufacturer should be able to get a simple node up and running correctly 
with much less effort than building a DCC stationary decoder. A manufacturer should be able to use inexpensive test tools and test suites, while they are building their product, which make it easier 
to ensure their product is implemented correctly and will work with other devices. 

(See [wiki:GaM/EasyImpl related detail page].)
----
=== Bi-directional Support ===

''Goal:'' Bi-directional Exchange of Information. 

''Measure:'' All products should be able transmit and receive information to/from the bus. 
Feedback of information such as Block Occupancy Detection should be fundamental to the bus. As 
such, success here would be that a more sophisticated BOD could report not only occupancy, but 
optional additional information, such as the locomotive or rolling stock unique number, as well as 
yet-to-be determined information. 

(See [wiki:GaM/bidir related detail page].)
---- 
=== Free IP ===

''Goal:'' The Standards and/or RPs should be free from intellectual-property 
restrictions from parties other than the NMRA. 


(See [wiki:GaM/FreeIP related detail page].)
----
=== Transport Agnostic ===

''Goal:'' Allow different transport mechanisms for messages. 

''Measure:'' If a company has another method for connecting devices, such as wireless or 
another wired method, they can substitute their own transport mechanism and still use all the other 
standards/RPs and automated test suites. 

(See [wiki:GaM/TransportAgnostic related detail page].)
----
=== Train Agnostic ===

''Goal:'' Support controlling trains when the network is connected to a train-control 
system. 

''Measure:'' The NMRANet should be able to connect, via bridge products, to any train 
control system, such as DCC, DC, or PWM, to allow interaction with each other. A hand-held throttle on NMRANet can control a locomotive on DCC, DC, or PWM. Similarly, you can have a bridge between a DCC command station and the NMRANet that will allow the DCC hand controller, for example, to throw a turnout motor attached to NMRANet. 

(See [wiki:GaM/TrainAgnostic related detail page].)
----
=== Discoverable ===

''Goal:'' Allow a user to find out what devices are connected and how they're 
configured on a layout. 

''Measure:'' You can connect a laptop to a layout it has never seen before. The configuration software can query the layout, provide a list of all the nodes attached to the layout, display how each node is configured, and show how nodes are interconnected and interact with each other. In addition, you can save the configuration of an entire layout and later restore it (in case you want to make some changes, and then decide to go back to what you had). 

(See [wiki:GaM/Discoverable related detail page].)
----
=== Self Describing ===

''Goal:'' Devices should describe themselves. 

''Measure:'' You can connect a computer to a type of node that it has never seen before. The 
computer can display the manufacturer of the node, the number of devices inside the node, the configuration variables, actions, reaction, etc. All of this information can be used to generate a user-friendly interface on the fly that allows configuring a node with text prompts. 

(See [wiki:GaM/SelfDesc related detail page].)
----
=== Testable ===

''Goal:'' Allow components to be easily tested for compliance. 

''Measure:'' Components can be easily tested for compliance using available tools and standard test suite. 

(See [wiki:GaM/Testable related detail page].)
----
=== Compliance ===

''Goal:'' A name protected by a trademark that NMRA can use to help ensure 
compliance. 

''Measure:'' A manufacturer should be able to obtain a license to use the NMRANet name and 
logo when their product successfully passes a test suite. To comply with these standards a product should be capable of being connected to a real layout or a "white-box" simulation of a layout and pass all designed tests. These tests would examine the products ability to keep up with bandwidth requirements as well as make 100% compatible protocol exchange. Using standardized buses such as CAN, USB, Ethernet, ZigBee or 802.11 wireless would negate the need for a low level compliance test. 

(See [wiki:GaM/Compliance related detail page].)
----
=== First-Time Use ===

''Goal:'' A new user can buy a device and have it work.  

''Measure:'' A user new to NRMAnet can buy a single device, take it home and have it do 
something useful and interesting without having to buy any other special hardware, or another device.

(See [wiki:GaM/FirstTime related detail page].)
