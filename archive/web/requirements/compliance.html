= Compliance =

A name protected by a trademark that NMRA can use to help ensure compliance.

A manufacturer should be able to obtain a license to use the NMRANet name and logo when their product successfully passes a test suite. To comply with these standards a product should be capable of being connected to a real layout or a "white-box" simulation of a layout and pass all designed tests. These tests would examine the products ability to keep up with bandwidth requirements as well as make 100% compatible protocol exchange. Using standardized busses such as CAN, USB, Ethernet, ZigBee? or 802.11 wireless would negate the need for a low level compliance test.

==== Features ====

==== Issues ====

=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====
 * S9.6 uses industry standard connections.  By not modifying these standards at all, commercial-off-the-shelf implementations require only limited testing at the electrical level.* The first version of S9.6 specifically includes: 
  * Ethernet -- A ubiquitous high-speed high capacity network, which is available on almost all computers and many cellphones.  Common usage network ancillary devices are available at low commodity prices including hubs, routers, and wireless routers.  
  * CAN -- An industrial strength differential two-wire bus, designed by Bosch for the automobile market, commonly used in industry and academia for interconnection of equipment, including high electrical-noise areas such as factory floors and accelerators.  Again, bridges, extenders, and relays are easily available. 
 * S9.6 can also be applied to other buses, such as I2C, multi-drop RS232 and RS485, and to wireless, such as 802.54.2 and WiFi.  By staying with standard communications links, additional capability can be added without requiring the development of communications test suites.

Above the level of the inter-node connections, NMRAnet S9.6 operates with the exchange of well-formatted messages and state-machine based protocols.  Conformance with these can be explicitly tested.  NMRAnet S9.6 documents clearly list which parts are mandatory (must be implemented and tested), which components are optional, and which parts of the documents are just non-normative discussion.

==== Issues ====
 * Only preliminary work has been done on a specifying a test suite.  It will likely take considerable work to make a robust but simple testing suite.  
 * There are issues associated with permission to use NMRAnet for development before product certification; timing of testing vs product announcement; fair-use and comparative use of trademarks; etc that are not S9.6-specific issues, and need to be resolved by higher level within the NMRA.  Until those are resolved, it's not possible to say whether the NMRAnet S9.6 approach is compatible.

==== Footnote ====
* A separate decisions to be made about testing of non-standard implementations of the low level connections.  Are they forbidden, just require extra testing, or are they permitted?  As an example, consider a manufacturer who wanted to develop their own CAN controller, instead of using pre-existing silicon.
