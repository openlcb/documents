Customers can easily connect many-to-many devices, and connect to legacy systems.

You can buy devices from any manufacturer that were designed without knowledge of the other devices and make them work together.

=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ==== 
 * Many-to-many: 
  * S9.6 uses a clean Producer/Consumer (P/C) Event Model which allows for many-to-many interactions between devices.  
 * No knowledge of other devices:
  * S9.6 uses large node and event IDs which are world-wide unique*.  This means that there will be no conflicts between devices or their events.  
  * The S9.6 P/C model lets devices from two different manufacturer work seamlessly together, without either device having knowledge of how the other works internally.  
 * Legacy Systems: [[BR]] S9.6 is able to connect to legacy systems through the use of intelligent gateways, which make the legacy system look like a fully functional set of S9.6 devices.  For example: 
  * MERG RPC is a serial bus that transfers raw data to and from a 'stack' of input/output modules.  An intelligent gateway stores the RPC stack's state, and reports state changes as S9.6 events and responds to S9.6 events by transferring the changed state to the RPC stack.   
  * DCC commands are directly translated into S9.6 events by encapsulating the DCC command and DCC-address into S9.6 64-bit event numbers. Similarly, S9.6 events are translated to their corresponding DCC packet by extracting the command and DCC-address information from the S9.6 event number.   

==== Issues ====
 * S9.6 connections to legacy systems are in the demonstration-phase.    

* No formal mechanism has been established for the distribution of S9.6 IDs.  However, IDs have already been assigned via NMRA manufacturer numbers, NMRA membership, and MERG membership numbers.  We would expect that the controlling body would set-up some mechanism, possibly by an automated Internet form, that will distribute IDs to other manufacturers, organizations, groups, and individuals on a as-needed basis.
