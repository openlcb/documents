= Extensible =

Allow additional functionality to be added easily, whether by the NMRA, or manufacturers.

The NMRA can add Standards and/or RPs on top of the bus to define new capabilities. Additionally, manufacturers can add their own proprietary functionally between their own devices.

=== S 9.5 ===

==== Features ====

==== Issues ====

=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====
 * S9.6 provides three basic communications mechanisms (event notification; datagrams; stream transfer) that provide a strong basis for higher-level functionality. 

 * The use of a pure Producer/Consumer Model for global notification in S9.6 provides excellent opportunity to add functionality while maintaining compatibility.  

==== Issues ====
The S9.6 development team have had only preliminary discussions about adding proprietary protocols, however, they see no technical impediment to this goal.  

S9.6 defines how the Node and Event universal identifiers are allocated by a combination of delegation and central (NMRA) record-keeping.  A similar mechanism for future protocol identifiers is yet to be defined.
