=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====
 * S9.6 documents a basic set of messages, which can be automatically tested by a test suite.  It also documents three specific protocols (event exchange; datagrams; streams) that can be individually tested.  In general, testability has been a criterion all along.
 * Testing suggestions are being written into each draft Standard and RP.  These form a starting point for a test suite. Having them right in the S&RP document ensures that product developers are aware of them.
 * As part of developing prototype implementations, suitable tests are being developed in parallel. 

==== Issues ====
 * The development of a S9.6 test suite is only in preliminary stages.   As of this writing on Aug 19, 2009, there are 154 tests defined, implemented and available in SVN.
