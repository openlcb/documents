= Easy to Implement =

Easy and inexpensive to implement products that are reliable and compatible for vendors wishing to create products.

A manufacturer should be able to get a simple node up and running correctly with much less effort than building a DCC stationary decoder. A manufacturer should be able to use inexpensive test tools and test suites, while they are building their product, which make it easier to ensure their product is implemented correctly and will work with other devices.

==== Issues ====

=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====
 * S9.6 specifies the minimum requirements of all nodes.  
 * S9.6 provides algorithms and mechanisms required for obtaining node IDs and CAN aliases.   
 * S9.6 provides example implementations of nodes based on platforms which include Arduino-compatible and MERG hardware.    
 * S9.6 provides example firmware written in "C", which eases porting to other platforms.    
==== Issues ====
 * S9.6 requires more memory resources for storage of its relatively large 48-bit node IDs and 64-bit event numbers compared to other proposals, and this ''may'' translate to moderately more expensive devices at the high-end of functionality.  However, other efficiencies in software and algorithms should make up for this.   
 * S9.6 CAN event messages will fill the entire CAN frame, and, as a consequence, CAN bandwidth  will be limited to about 1k event-frames per second.  We do not see this as a significant problem, since NMRAnet S9.6 transparently supports multiple CAN segments, and each segment is in any case limited to about 100 nodes for electrical reasons. Note that CAN is designed to work well at 100% of its bandwidth capacity, so segments can expect to work at 1000 messages per second if needed.
