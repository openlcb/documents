= Optional PC Control =

A PC can provide higher-level functionality, such as a CTC Interlocking, and system functions such as monitoring, testing, and debugging.

A computer attached to the bus can provide more advanced functionality, such as CTC, and system-control functions such as: monitoring, testing and debugging

=== S 9.5 ===

==== Features ====

==== Issues ====

=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====
 * S9.6 allows multiple connections for multiple computers.  
 * S9.6 allows multiple Network Managers, Configuration, and other programs to be present and operational at the same time, which will be important for large layouts, such as museums and large modular meets.  These can come and go as needed to do their job; they do not need to be present at startup or shutdown.
 * S9.6 has multiple ways to connect a computer either directly or via various bridges: 
  * Ethernet directly
  * Wirelessly, for example by Wifi via commodity Wifi-Ethernet routers
  * USB to CAN bridge

==== Issues ====
S9.6 is in the process of specifying testing and monitoring protocols.  The data transfer protocols (datagrams, streaming, event notification) are in place. A protocol for remote logging is under discussion, but there is not yet a reference implementation.  Only preliminary work has been done on protocols for remote testing and diagnosis.
