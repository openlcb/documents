=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====

NMRAnet S9.6 uses standard communications links (CAN, EtherNet, USB, etc) without modification.  Manufacturers who use commercial implementations of those, and comply with the conditions of their suppliers, will have no IP issues.  Manufacturers who want to create their own "almost-Ethernet", "almost-CAN", etc might possibly encounter IP issues, but their solutions won't be NMRAnet S9.6 compliant in any case.

The NMRAnet S9.6 documents, prototype code and examples, are all being developed and made available under Open Source licenses.  Once an agreement on NMRA standardization has been reached, they will be freely and generally available to all.  Depending on their business model, manufacturers will have to write their own manuals and software to implement NMRAnet S9.6 or comply with the license terms of other developers who provide solutions.

==== Issues ====
The NMRA's own licensing terms are inconsistent with this point.
