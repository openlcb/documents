= Bi-directional Support =

Supports bi-directional exchange of information.

All products should be able transmit and receive information to/from the bus. Feedback of information such as Block Occupancy Detection should be fundamental to the bus. As such, success here would be that a more sophisticated BOD could report not only occupancy, but optional additional information, such as the locomotive or rolling stock unique number, as well as yet-to-be determined information.

=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====
 * S9.6's clean Consumer/Producer Event Model allows painless transfer of stateless data.  
 * S9.6's Datagrams and Streams will allow ample room for transfer of state information.  
==== Issues ====
 * The S9.6 has only had preliminary discussions regarding stateful data, and in particular regarding location state, such as will be required with RFID, Bi-Di, bar-coding, IR and other train/block detection methods.  However, we do not see any technical impediment to implementation.
