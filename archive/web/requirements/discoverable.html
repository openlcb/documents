= Discoverable =

Allow a user to find out what devices are connected and how they're configured on a layout.

You can connect a laptop to a layout it has never seen before. The configuration software can query the layout, provide a list of all the nodes attached to the layout, display how each node is configured, and show how nodes are interconnected and interact with each other. In addition, you can save the configuration of an entire layout and later restore it (in case you want to make some changes, and then decide to go back to what you had).

=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====
 * Connection and discovery:
  * Because each S9.6 device has a factory set unique ID, devices will never conflict with preexisting devices on the layout, and many can be added to a layout simultaneously without concern about duplicate addresses.
 * Configuration and device teaching:
  * S9.6 has well defined protocol to retrieve P/C event use from nodes.  
  * S9.6 nodes contain compressed XML containing a description of the device.  This is sufficiently complete that a ''de novo'' node can be added to a layout and then queried as to its characteristics such that it can be programmed/configured.  
  * Collateral information will be obtainable via files or online, including test suites, manuals, and configuration tools.  
  * In addition, at the manufacturer's discretion, devices may be programmable using the S9.6 protocol for local programming, or programmed by a standalone programming device.  
  * To get the full benefit of a device, it is likely a dedicated or generic software program, the equivalent of open-source JMRI project, will be preferable, as it will allow the use of user descriptive terms for all of the programming parameters. 
 * Saving and restoring device content and inter-device relationships: [[BR]]S9.6 will have a number of ways to back-up device content and inter-device relationships.  
  * As described above, there is a well-described S9.6 protocol to retrieve device relationships.  
  * S9.6 device content can be read and written using the Datagram protocol.   
  * In addition, device content is serializable and is downloaded, copied and stored using the S9.6 Streaming protocol.  
  * The stored content can then be restored to original device, or another device if the user wants to duplicate or replace a defective device.  The restored or replacement device will be a full participant in the original device's relationships.    

==== Issues ====
 * Preliminary specification of the XML schema has been made, but further development is necessary.  
 * Preliminary adaptation of JMRI tools to S9.6 has been made, and requires roll-out once licensing issues have been resolved with the NMRA.
