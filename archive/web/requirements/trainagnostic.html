= Train Agnostic =

Support controlling trains when the network is connected to a train-control system.

The NMRANet should be able to connect, via bridge products, to any train control system, such as DCC, DC, or PWM, to allow interaction with each other. A hand-held throttle on NMRANet can control a locomotive on DCC, DC, or PWM. Similarly, you can have a bridge between a DCC command station and the NMRANet that will allow the DCC hand controller, for example, to throw a turnout motor attached to NMRANet.

=== S 9.5 ===

==== Features ====

==== Issues ====

=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====
 * S9.6 is fully committed to meeting this goal.  Prototyping has started on LocoNet and DCC connections.

==== Issues ====
 * Only very preliminary steps have been taken to achieve what is hoped is a solution that is simple, elegant, unifying, and comprehensive.  
 * We note that this criteria is inconsistent with the NMRA charge to the NMRAnet Working Group. This must be resolved at some higher organizational level.
