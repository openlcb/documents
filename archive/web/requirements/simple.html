= Simple =

Make it easy for a novice customers to install and configure without technical knowledge (should be easier than DCC systems).

A customer can change the configuration of any device at any time with a simple interface that includes text descriptions of settings, thus greatly reducing the need for a manual and required level of learned expertise. This mechanism should also reduce the support burden to the manufacturer. In addition:

* You can disconnect a node, reconnect it somewhere else on the same net and have is still work without having to make any configuration changes.

==== Features ====
Configuration methods:
 * S9.6 defines a push-button configuration method that will allow simple configuration without the need for attached PC or configuration device*.  (This is defined so that it will inter-operate, but manufacturers may omit it from their products if they wish)  In this simplest form, a few button pushes on two boards will associate them so an input on one triggers the output on another, e.g. a pushbutton operates a distance turnout.
 * For more complex configuration, S9.6 nodes all include detailed self-descriptions in a defined format.  This permits the construction of stand-alone configuration tools that will just connect and work, no separate PC needed.  We anticipate that limited tools of this kind will be available for about the current cost of a DCC throttle.
 * Programs in personal computers are full S9.6 NMRAnet partners, and will be able to provide configuration assistance limited only by the ingenuity and motivation of their programmers.

Simplicity:
 * Configuring events in S9.6 is simplified by the world-unique event ID numbers.  Configuration tools don't have to keep records of event IDs used, avoid conflicts, or generally have to worry about them at all.
 * Since each node has a unique node ID, they can be easily  be cross-referenced on the Internet so that manufacturers can supply support, including configuration tools and manuals.  
 * Because the S9.6 48-bit node IDs are world-wide unique, free relocation of nodes without risk of node collisions is guaranteed.  Nodes can be moved around, and working modules interconnected, with no reprogramming required to retain their existing function. 

==== Issues ====
 * S9.6 48-bit node IDs and 64-bit event numbers incur a moderate penalty in terms of space and search time, however, this is mitigated by:
  * This space/time penalty is far outweighed by the benefit in terms of ease of use, safety, and reduced software costs.   
  * The full node ID only needs to be saved by its owner and bridges, and not other nodes. 
  * On CAN, a shortened 16-bit alias, the NIDa, is used for the full node ID.  
  * The price of memory is falling, and memory other than eeprom can be used to store events, such as flash memory.  
  * Search algorithms can be chosen that allow event matching with only a minor speed penalty over shorter event numbers.  

==== Footnote ====
* We are only beginning to prototype the mechanism for push-button configuration of nodes (e.g. without an attached PC).  We're sure it will work; we're not so sure whether model railroaders will like it. We've got a PC-based simulation you're welcome to try. It simulates several nodes, their pushbuttons & LEDs, and their input/output connections on the screen so you can play with the push-button protocol.  If you want a copy, ask on the development mailing list or build it from SVN.
