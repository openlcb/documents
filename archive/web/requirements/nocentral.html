=== S 9.5 ===

==== Features ====

==== Issues ====

=== S 9.6 ===

The S9.6 protocols provide both direct node-to-node communications (datagrams, streams), and broadcast notifications (events).  No central facility is required for any of these.

==== Features ====
 1. S9.6 does not mandate the existence of either a Network Manager nor Configuration Manager, although these can be used if desired.   
 1. On CAN, S9.6 node ID aliases are negotiated between the nodes present, and a NM is not required for this.
