= Transport Agnostic =

Allow different transport mechanisms for messages.

If a company has another method for connecting devices, such as wireless or another wired method, they can substitute their own transport mechanism and still use all the other standards/RPs and automated test suites.

=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====
 * S9.6 is designed to be transport agnostic, and is being prototyped specifically on TCP/IP (Ethernet, wireless) and CAN networks. It can be implemented on transports such as multi-drop RS-232, RS485, serial phone lines, cell-phones and others not yet designed by using the S9.6 concept of a "wire protocol" to map specific NMRAnet S9.6 messages onto a specific transport mechanism.
 * Use of a CAN bus imposes specific constraints and features, however, S9.6 mitigates these in the CAN-specific wire protocol:
  * CAN frame size is limited
   * S9.6 uses 29-bit headers in order to maximize CAN frame length to 13-bytes.  
   * S9.6 48-bit node IDs are converted to shorter local 16-bit aliases.  
   * S9.6 Datagrams allow transfer of data greater than 8-bytes.  
   * S9.6 Streams allow large quantities of data to be transferred.  
  * CAN frame-headers are required to be unique
   * S9.6 node ID aliases are present in every frame header and guarantees it is unique, collisions cannot occur.  
 As a consequence CAN nodes are full participants in the larger NMRAnet network. Similar adaptions should allow NMRAnet to work over any reliable transport mechanism.
