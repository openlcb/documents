= Self Describing =

Devices should describe themselves.

You can connect a computer to a type of node that it has never seen before. The computer can display the manufacturer of the node, the number of devices inside the node, the configuration variables, actions, reaction, etc. All of this information can be used to generate a user-friendly interface on the fly that allows configuring a node with text prompts.

=== S 9.5 ===

==== Features ====

==== Issues ====

=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====
 * Because each S9.6 device has a factory set unique ID, devices will never conflict with preexisting devices on the layout, and many can be added to a layout simultaneously without concern.  
 * S9.6 has well defined protocol to retrieve P/C event use from nodes.  
 * S9.6 nodes contain compressed XML containing a description of the device.  This is sufficiently complete that a ''de novo'' node can be added to a layout and then queried as to its characteristics such that it can be programmed to some basic level.  
 * Collateral information will be obtainable via files or online, including test suites, manuals, and configuration tools.  
 * In addition, at the manufacturer's discretion, devices may be programmable using the S9.6 protocol for local programming, or programmed by a standalone programming device.  
 * To get the full benefit of a device, it is likely a dedicated or generic software program, the equivalent of JRMI, will be preferable, as it will allow the use of user descriptive terms for all of the programming parameters.  

==== Issues ====
 * Preliminary specification of the XML schema has been made, but further development is necessary.  
 * Preliminary adaptation of JMRI tools to S9.6 has been made, and requires roll-out.
