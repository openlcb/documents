=== S 9.5 ===

==== Features ====

==== Issues ====

=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====
 * S9.6 has world-wide unique node IDs, which means that new users do not need to worry about conflict between nodes, in fact they do not need to concern themselves with IDs at all.  
 * S9.6 will have a comprehensive push-button programming model*, notionally called the "blue/gold algorithm" after the recommended color of the buttons, which allows new owners to connect two nodes out of the box and make them fully able to interact via event messages.

==== Issues ====

 * We need to put some work into creating introductory articles, convention clinics, etc to help model railroaders become comfortable with NMRAnet S9.6.  The excellent work done by the NMRA DCC WG to get DCC accepted is an example of what's needed.

==== Footnote ====
* We are only beginning to prototype the mechanism for push-button configuration of nodes (e.g. without an attached PC).  We're sure it will work; we're not so sure whether model railroaders will like it. We've got a PC-based simulation you're welcome to try. It simulates several nodes, their pushbuttons & LEDs, and their input/output connections on the screen so you can play with the push-button protocol.  If you want a copy, ask on the development mailing list or build it from SVN.
