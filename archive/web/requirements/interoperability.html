= Interoperability =

Products from one company can work with products from any other company, and with legacy systems.

Manufacturers can easily test their nodes for interoperability using standard tests. Any device passing these tests should be able to work with other devices passing these tests. Likewise, it should be easy for manufacturers to build bridges to systems like DCC or Loconet that allows NMRAnet turnouts to be controlled from DCC throttles, and DCC engines/accessories to be controlled from NMRAnet.

==== Features ====

=== S 9.6 ===

The S9.6 protocols are being documented at a high level, such that any proper implementation will interoperate with any other.  At the same time, proper functioning of low-level detail is being insured via test and example implementations. 

Care is being taken to define a protocol that can be used by large and small manufacturers without giving anybody an undue advantage. For example, the test and example implementations are available for manufacturers to study and, subject to licensing, use as the basis for their own products.

(Non-normative) examples of connections to DCC, LocoNet, and eventually other systems are being created to demonstrate interoperability.

==== Features ====
 1. S9.6 nodes have world-wide unique node IDs, and therefore there is no risk of clashes between products from different companies. 
 1. The S9.6 48-bit node ID allows legacy IDs to be encapsulated when bridged onto S9.6.  

==== Issues ====
S9.6 has not yet specified any specific conformance testing criteria or methodology.  We are developing an extensive series of tests for development purposes, which may in the future form the basis of conformance tests, but the process for doing that has not been specified by the NMRA yet.
