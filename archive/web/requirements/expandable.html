Allow very large layouts (a higher-level of technical knowledge required is OK for large layouts).

A very large museum layout might be divided into distinct segments that work together as a single network. You can use a device, such as a hub, repeater, or switch, to connect multiple segments to form a single network.

=== S 9.6 ===

==== Features ====
 * S9.6 is designed to not only handle large layouts, but to minimize the problems inherent in a large heterogeneous layout.  
 * S9.6 supports Modular Layouts and large Modular Meets, by minimizing the integration tasks required when joining multiple independent layouts and net segments into a cohesive whole.  To this end, it has these features: 
  * 48-bit node IDs ensure there are no node conflicts. 
  * 64-bit event numbers with allocation criteria that eliminates event number conflicts and re-programming tasks other than those required to integrate adjacent sub-layouts by configuring their mutual edge events.  
  * Multiple integrated transports including, but not limited to Ethernet and CAN.  This allows local area CAN nets that can be linked by a higher-speed backbone bus.   
  * Intelligent bridges with automatic routing and traffic-limiting - messages are transferred to the network segments containing nodes that need them, and they don't appear where not needed, all automatically.   
  * The ability to have multiple computers running configurations tools simultaneously.  
  * The ability to define virtual nodes and run testing across the network.  
 * S9.6 supports museum and other large layouts by having these features: 
  * Use of off-the-shelf components, such as CAN-USB bridges, Ethernet routers and wireless routers. 
  * Industrial strength noise resistant local network hardware, including Ethernet and CAN.  
  * Allows use of multiple hard-, firm-, and software solutions for the control and display of the net.  Mulitple glass-panels, configuration tools, and testing tools can be used simultaneously.
