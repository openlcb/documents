NMRA Proposal Documentation 
</H1>
<P><B>Update:</B> This page was originally about the OpenLCB group's
efforts to work with the NMRA on a set of NMRAnet documents. OpenLCB
members put significant work into that, as shown by the discussions
in the 2nd part of this page, below the line. Unfortunately, at their
February 2011 meeting the NMRA Board adopted an unauthorized
modification of some work done by an NMRAnet working group as NMRA
Standard S9.5.1. This unacceptable situation was documented in detail
on <A HREF="response.html">other pages</A>. OpenLCB withdrew from the
NMRA effort. During Spring 2011, we put a huge amount of effort into
getting that decision revisited and the systematic problems in the
NMRA corrected. 
</P>
<P>At the NMRA Board meeting and Convention in July 2011, we were
told that the Board had voted to de-adopt the S9.5 Standard, and that
the causes of the original incorrect action have been removed.
Although as of this writing (August 1, 2011) we have not yet seen the
promised written minutes of the meetings, we are cautiously
optimistic that with new people involved the NMRA's standards effort
for NMRAnet will be back on track. Certain elements of the NMRA have
terrible record of living up to commitments, however, so we're
leaving this entire page up in case the troubles continue and people
need to understand the history. 
</P>
<P>In hope of progress, we have submitted current versions of our
draft Standard [<A HREF="CanPhysicalS_201107.pdf">pdf</A>][<A HREF="CanPhysicalS_201107_changes.pdf">with
changes marked</A>][<A HREF="CanPhysicalS_201107.odt">odt</A>] and
Technical Note [<A HREF="CanPhysicalTN_201107.pdf">pdf</A>][<A HREF="CanPhysicalTN_201107_changes.pdf">with
changes marked</A>][<A HREF="CanPhysicalTN_201107.odt">odt</A>]. 
</P>
<P>We are also in the process of developing a node to be included in
a DevKit.  The NMRA has agree to purchase some of these for NMRAnet
development and demonstration.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We'll provide updates here as they
occur. We hope to see demonstrated progress by Spring 2012.

Index</H2>
<P>The NMRA is interested in defining a “NMRAnet®” as a
standard, and OpenLCB™ wanted to take part in that. Several people
put significant efforts into created strong NMRA documentation, and
this page contains documents for our effort in that direction. Our
own Specifications and Explanations are available in a <A HREF="../specs/index.html">separate
directory</A>. The separate “<A HREF="../documents">documents</A>”
directory contains our development documentation.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the NMRA has allowed Di Voss to entirely hijack
this effort in favor of the specific activities of his brother Don.
This resulted in the NMRA adopting a very modified version of the
common physical layer standard that had been developed with OpenLCB
help. <A HREF="response.html">More details</A> on these unacceptable
actions and their poor decision can be found on a <A HREF="response.html">separate
page</A>. The net result is that we don't currently anticipate taking
part in the NMRAnet process again. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="background: #ccccff">Physical Layer
Standard: S 9.x.1</H2>
<P>After the summer 2010 NMRA meeting in Milwaukee, the NMRA wanted
to start with a “Physical Layer” standard for NMRAnet
implementations that use CAN. Various discussion ensued. The
following documents were submitted for NMRA approval on September 17,
2010. The NMRA <A HREF="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Chapter_32">decided
they needed to reformat them</A>, which took three weeks, but after
that they were proposed for a vote on October 7, 2010:</P>

information from people working on NMRAnet proposals. In 2008, 2009
and 2010 the OpenLCB group wrote replies to those, along with
introductory information, which are linked from this section. We've

NMRA definitions</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="background: #e6e6ff">Standards</H3>
<P>Standards are required of all implementations. They therefore are
the baseline, mandatory functionality. 
</P>
<P>From the DCC Working Group: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An NMRA Standard is a public document that
specifies the minimum requirements for interchange of equipment. To
be granted a conformance seal, a manufacturer must meet all relevant
requirements specified in all standards. &quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="background: #e6e6ff; page-break-after: avoid">
Recommended Practices</H3>
<P>Recommended Practices describe optional features and capabilities.
Those need not be present, but if they are present they must function
as described in the RP. 
</P>
<P>From the NMRA DCC Working Group: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An NMRA Recommended Practice is a public document
that specifies the maximum requirements for interchange of equipment.
For any DCC product to be granted a conformance seal, the product
must not violate any recommended practice. &quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Although the terms of both Standards and Recommended Practices use
the “must” construction, note the difference between “must
meet” and “must not violate”. In practice, it's not at all
clear what “the maximum requirements for interchange” means.
Perhaps that was intended to be “the requirements for maximum
interchange”?</P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="background: #e6e6ff; page-break-after: avoid">
Technical Notes</H3>
<P>Technical Notes are non-normative documents which convey
information useful to the model railroading community. 
</P>
<P>From the DCC Working Group: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An NMRA Technical Note is Technical Department
document used to convey information useful to the model railroading
community. Technical Notes are only available to NMRA members.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>This last sentence seems ominous – the OpenLCB group
will want information to be available to <U>all</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">
NMRAnet users. Maybe the NMRA has some other type of doc we can use
for technical information. Or we can write a “For Dummies” book
outside the auspices of the NMRA... </SPAN></I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There doesn't seem to be a single system of numbering for
Technical Notes. Some are based on dates (TN-2004-1), some are linked
to standards (TN-9.2.1), and some have multipart numbers TN-3-05.
