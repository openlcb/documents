<P><B>Update:</B> This page was originally about NMRA's S9.5.1
Standard, which was an unauthorized modification of some work done by
an NMRAnet working group based on the OpenLCB physical layer
documentation. We wrote the 2nd part of this page, below the line,
shortly after the NMRA Board adopted S9.5.1 in February 2011. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">At the NMRA Board meeting and
Convention in July 2011, we were told that the Board had voted to
de-adopt the S9.5 Standard, and that the causes of the original
incorrect action have been removed. Although as of this writing
(August 1, 2011) we have not yet seen the promised written minutes of
the meetings, we are cautiously optimistic that with new people
involved the NMRA's standards effort for NMRAnet will be back on
track. Certain elements of the NMRA have terrible record of living up
to commitments, however, so we're leaving this entire page up in case
the troubles continue and people need to understand the history. We
hope to see demonstrated progress by Fall 2011. 
</P>
<HR>
<P>In February 2011, the NMRA adopted Standard S9.5.1 for the CAN
physical layer of their “NMRAnet” effort. This was based on the
OpenLCB physical layer <A HREF="../specs/CanPhysicalS.pdf">specification</A>
and <A HREF="../specs/CanPhysicalTN.pdf">technical note</A>, but the
NMRA made significant modifications to the CAN part of the
specification. Four of us (JD, DH, BJ and AS) worked on those OpenLCB
documents. We think that the NMRA's decision was a serious error. We
want people to know about this situation so that when things
eventually go seriously wrong, the rest of the communities developing
CAN-based layout control buses won't be discredited by the inevitable
results of the NMRA's poorly-considered decision. 
</P>
<P>Briefly, the NMRA has adopted an S9.5.1 Standard that cannot
perform as promised. The NMRA's new NMRAnet S9.5.1 Physical Layer
Standard is based on specific modifications to the international CAN
standard to get “extended performance”. Layouts built using this
NMRAnet specification will be unable to live up to those promises for
“extended performance”.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Technical summary</H3>
<P>Di Voss, in his role as NMRA Standards and Conformance Department
Manager, has decided on an approach to NMRAnet protocols that does
not have strong capabilities for handling more than one CAN segment.
This motivates him to find ways to put as many nodes as possible on a
single CAN segment, so that only one segment is needed. (The Voss
NMRAnet effort has not discussed a solution for connecting smart
phones and other devices that do not have native CAN interfaces)
There are multiple technical issues that effect how big a CAN segment
can be, and the international CAN standard has addressed these in a
balanced way. Di's brother Don Voss has used information from two
vendor notes (out of the huge number available for CAN; see e.g the
list of 18 in the OpenLCB Technical Note on this topic) to devise
changes to the CAN standard that address just one of these
limitations. From this, the Voss brothers conclude that a much larger
number of nodes can be supported on a segment, as shown in the
formula and Figure 1 in the NMRA's S9.5.1 Standard.</P>
<P>OpenLCB developers with years of CAN experience disagree with the
Voss brothers' simplistic analysis. The Voss changes to the CAN
specification make promises that cannot be kept, because these
“extensions” to CAN have only addressed one of the many issues
involved in supporting longer CAN segments with a larger number of
nodes. This has been explained repeatedly to them in significant
detail, [<A HREF="BoardLetterAnalysis.pdf">1</A>] [<A HREF="2011-02-16TechComments.pdf">2</A>]
and those interested in the technical issues can get more information
from those notes. 
</P>
<P>By imposing “extensions” to the international CAN standard,
the NMRA Standard makes existing commercial CAN hardware
non-conforming, which model railroaders will understand to mean that
they can't use them. This restricts hobbyist choices, and channels
their purchases to vendors selected by the Voss brothers.</P>
<P>NMRAnet-conforming hardware will work reasonably well on short CAN
segments with a few nodes. Longer segments may work better or worse,
depending on whether NMRAnets specified power and termination methods
work better or worse than the CAN standards. Where the results are
most problematic is where the CAN segment is longer and has more
nodes than the OpenLCB recommendations, but still within the NMRAnet
recommendations. Those segments will sometimes work reliably, but
since they have greatly reduced margins, there will be other
circumstances where the segment does not work reliably. When this
happens, the blame should be placed firmly at the feet of the Voss
brothers and the NMRA for blindly backing them.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Historical Background</H3>
<P>How did we get to this undesirable situation?</P>
<P>At the 2007 Detroit NMRA convention, several groups working on a
new approaches to a &quot;Layout Control Bus&quot; got together for
discussion. Don Voss was working on an RS-485 approach, a few other
people were working on another RS-485 approach, and several people
were developing CAN-based solutions. Di Voss enlisted John
Socha-Leialoha to develop some <A HREF="http://nmranet.sourceforge.net/NMRAGoalsAndMandate.pdf%3Egoals%3C/a%3Efor%20a%20common">measures
of success</A> was eventually generally accepted by everybody except
Don Voss. Don felt that the criteria were too far-reaching, and
covered items that he felt were not important. 
</P>
<P>An NMRAnet discussion and working group was established under the
leadership of Edward Richards. That <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nmranet-wg-tech/">discussion
went well</A>, with some significant technical progress, until Di
Voss decided to fire Edward Richards so that he could install his
brother in charge of the effort. Di Voss's post doing this can be
found <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nmranet-wg-tech/message/960">here</A>;
note that his description of Don's qualifications is substantially at
variance with the subsequent facts, including failing to mention that
Don had not even <U>read</U> the CAN specification at that point, let
alone had any experience designing CAN systems. Under Don Voss, the
effort collapsed completely. Over a couple months, a vibrant group
that had been making progress, had made decisions and created
prototypes, lost members and enthusiasm. The effort decayed away, as
can be seen in its <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NMRANETWG/">message
totals</A>. Don's behavior as group manager grew abusive and
threatened to split the group into two. Di Voss put Alex Shepherd in
charge of the group in August, and <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NMRANETWG/message/404">asked
for two separate proposals</A>, with Don's called S9.5 and the
OpenLCB effort renamed to S9.6 for the NMRA. Di said both proposals
would get an even-handed evaluation by a neutral panel, but Di never
convened the panel. It became clear that Di was only listening to
Don, and Don's behavior was becoming increasingly arbitrary. After
repeated requests for an open comparison, Di did call for
demonstrations at the 2009 NMRA convention, and the S9.6/OpenLCB
group made arrangements for several people to travel there, but Di
cancelled that event two days before it was to happen. 
</P>
<P>In the Spring of 2010, Di arranged for Don's S9.5 specification to
be listed on the NMRA web site as the choice for NMRAnet, with no
consideration of the other efforts. Di also wrote an article in the
June 2010 Scale Rails that described only Don's proposal for NMRAnet,
and included false statements about the work &amp; contributions of
other people. David Harris wrote an article for Scale Rails that
covered the S9.6/OpenLCB effort, but Di refused to allow it to be
published. 
</P>
<P>All of this was far from treating the efforts on an even-handed
basis, and showed clear preference for the work of Di's brother, even
though it was much less complete than other efforts. A number of
people protested this bias on Di's part, and he agreed to host an
event at the Summer 2010 NMRA Convention in Milwaukee where all
proposals would be &quot;fairly considered&quot;. There were displays
and presentations by OpenLCB, MERG CBUS, AT Bus, and Don's S9.5
effort (though Don threatened one OpenLCB organizer that he would
&quot;have my brother throw you out of the convention&quot; when
asked questions). Unfortunately, Di never even visited the
S9.6/OpenLCB, MERG CBUS or AT Bus demos, though he did manage to
spend an hour at the S9.5 demo. He made no effort to make a fair
comparison, nor did he enlist anybody else to make one. 
</P>
<P>Naively, and despite all this evidence, several of us thought
there was value in a consensus NMRAnet specification, at least to the
extent possible. In particular, John Day thought that he could work
with Don Voss and others to craft a common physical layer
specification that would let manufacturers provide circuit boards
that could be used for many different functions with suitable
software. Karl Kobel agreed to chair a group to do that, and <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NMRANET/">the
group was established</A> by Di Voss with the goal of sending him a
proposal in Fall 2010. There were active discussions in August and
September, including detailed negotiations over what should be in the
final document. Don Voss took part, as did others. Many people,
including Don and the authors of this note, made suggestions that
were accepted, and other suggestions that were not accepted. The
final documents (draft <A HREF="http://old.openlcb.org/trunk/srpdrafts/NMRA_20101007_S-9-x-1.pdf">standard
and </A><A HREF="http://old.openlcb.org/trunk/srpdrafts/NMRA_20101007_TN-9-x-1.pdf">technical
note</A>) were written by the four of us based on the discussions,
edited and revised through multiple rounds of additional discussions,
voted on and forwarded by Karl Kobel to Di Voss. 
</P>
<P>Imagine our surprise when, with literally <U>no</U> notice from
Di, the drafts that were published on the NMRA web site were not the
ones that had been voted on. Several features that Don had
championed, but that had been unanimously rejected by the rest of the
group, had been inserted by his brother Di before Di published it. 
</P>
<P>We've covered technical reasons for objecting to those in the
section above; we also believe that there are significant process and
fair play problems with this outcome. We documented those in a <A HREF="BoardLetter.pdf">letter
to the NMRA Board</A> but it was to no avail: The Board accepted a
deeply flawed recommendation by Di Voss in his role as Standards and
Conformance Department Manager, choosing to overlook a conflict of
interest that was clearly unfair and explicitly forbidden by the
<A HREF="http://www.nmra.org/national/nmra/Modified%20EHB%20Revised%2010-29-2010.pdf">NMRA's
own manual of procedures</A> (see section C 4.1). 
</P>
<P>And the NMRA wonders why it's hard to find qualified volunteers...
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Conclusion</H3>
<P>From this experience, we conclude that there is little point in
trying to align the OpenLCB efforts with the NMRA's process for
developing NMRAnet Standards. We may revisit this decision later on,
but for now, we wish the NMRA luck in its efforts, and we remind the
model railroading community that OpenLCB actually works.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There are some specific points in
conclusion:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The OpenLCB group will continue to
	do good work, developing useful capabilities in a professional
	manner. OpenLCB nodes will meet their performance specifications.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">NMRAnet will be what it is,
	developed as the NMRA wants.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Hardware that conforms to the NMRA

	OpenLCB software is available for it, and the hardware isn't limited
	in other ways. When operating like this, the NMRA-conforming
	hardware will fulfill OpenLCB performance expectations.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Hardware that conforms to the
	OpenLCB physical layer specification may or may not conform to the
	NMRA S9.5.1 Standard depending on choices by the designer. We expect
	that most custom-designed model railroad boards will. We expect that

	conform to the NMRA S9.5.1 Standard due to driver and termination
	choices.</P>
