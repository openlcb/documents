                                              1 Introduction (Informative)

   Minimal introductory material, only the stuff that's absolutely needed to understand the Standard.

                                              2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Any limitations to the area of use of the Standard.

                                          3 References and Context (Normative)

   Citations to other docs, as needed.

   Must appear in PIP.

   Need versioning support. Using the version number (by parts) to indicate the number of strings in that part would
   do it.

                                                    4 (To Be Merged)

   The node sending the STI request must wait for the entire reply from the responder before sending another STI
   request. (Included to simplify required logic in leaf nodes)

   Count version 1 and version 4 as the same, but require new nodes to send version 4. Version number doubles as
   string count.
