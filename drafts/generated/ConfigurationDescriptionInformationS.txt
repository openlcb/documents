                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This document defines a standard for the format of static information that describes the configuration
   options available on an OpenLCB node, called “Configuration Description Information (CDI)”.
   “Configuration Description Information” in this context refers to fixed information available from an
   OpenLCB device, via OpenLCB, so that other devices can properly and correctly configure it.

   This Standard does not address how the CDI is stored, retrieved, or used.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   CDI is intended to be used by a configurable, self-contained OpenLCB node to tell a Configuration Tool
   (CT) how to configure the node. The configuration tool will use the CDI information to help the user
   configure all aspects of the node's capabilities.

   The configurable values are expressed as variables, with each variable having a specific type, a size in
   bytes, a value for its memory space and address (to locate the variable), and name and description as
   user-readable strings so that users understand the use of the particular setting.

   Variables can be grouped together, groups can be repeated (for example if a node has multiple outputs)
   and nested to express complex configuration setups with concise description.

                                    3 References and Context (Informative)

                                            4 Content (Normative)

   The configuration description information for a node is invariant while the node has any OpenLCB
   connections in the Initialized state.

   The CDI has three parts:

     * Identification: Provides specific information about the type of the node.

     * ACDI: Indicates that certain configuration information in the node has a standardized simplified
       format.

     * Segments: The configuration information in the node is organized in zero or more segments, each of
       which contains zero or more configurable variables.  A variable is the basic unit of configuration.
       The segment definition specifies the organization of each segment. A segment consists of zero or
       more bytes within a linear address space.

                                             5 Format (Normative)

   The CDI is provided as a zero-terminated string of bytes. The bytes encode UTF-8 characters. There is no
   byte-order mark (BOM) at the start of the string. Lines in the string are delimited with 0x0A Newline
   (NL) characters.

   The content defines the configuration description information in XML 1.0 format using a specific XML
   vocabulary defined by an XML Schema. No extensions to XML 1.0 are permitted.

   This version of this Standard specifies version 1.4 of the schema.  That version of the schema is
   defined at https://openlcb.org/schema/cdi/1/4/cdi.xsd and in Appendix A of this document. The CDI
   content shall pass validation against its referenced schema. Nodes are not required to do the
   validation.

   The version number of an OpenLCB CDI schema contains two numbers: The major version first, and the minor
   version second.  

   The first line of the CDI is:

   <?xml version="1.0"?>

   to define the XML version of the content.

   The root element of the CDI XML is:

   <cdi xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://openlcb.org/schema/cdi/1/4/cdi.xsd">

   to define the OpenLCB CDI version of the content.

   The schema contents are normative.

   Numerical values in attributes and element text shall be specified as decimal numbers. OpenLCB nodes are
   not required to parse any other numeric format.

5.1 XML Elements

  5.1.1 <identification> Element

   The <identification> element, if present, specifies manufacturer-provided identification information
   about the node. This information is not user-editable. If this element is provided and the node also
   supports the OpenLCB Simple Node Information Protocol (SNIP), the contents of the SNIP Reply shall match
   the respective tags in the <identification> element. An optional <link> sub-element can provide an
   optional  hyperlink to additional information.  An optional <map> sub-element can provide one or more
   key-value pairs to be optionally displayed.

   If this element is provided, and the node also provides the <acdi> element, the contents provided by the
   ACDI spaces shall match the respective tags in the <identification> element.

  5.1.2 <acdi> Element

   The <acdi> element, if specified without the attribute `fixed', or with the attribute `fixed=”4”' or
   higher, specifies that the following information is available for read:

   Space Address Size (bytes) Type   Description      
   252   0       1            int    Version          
   252   1       41           string Manufacturer     
   252   42      41           string Model            
   252   83      21           string Hardware version 
   252   104     21           string Software version 

   The value at the version variable shall be the same as the value of the attribute `fixed'.

   The <acdi> element, if specified without the attribute `var', or with the attribute `var=”2”' or higher,
   specifies that the following information is available for read and write:

   Space Address Size (bytes) Type   Description               
   251   0       1            int    Version                   
   251   1       63           string User-supplied name        
   251   64      64           string User-supplied description 

   The value at the version variable shall be the same as the value of the attribute `var'.

   The <acdi> element shall be specified if and only if the Protocol Support Reply message carries the
   `ACDI' bit set. See the OpenLCB Message Network Standard for the Protocol Support Reply message.

   If the <acdi> element is specified, and the node also supports the OpenLCB Simple Node Information
   Protocol (SNIP), then the information provided by the SNIP Reply shall match the respective values
   provided in the ACDI space.

   A node may, but is not required to, express the same configuration options as specific segments and data
   elements therein.

  5.1.3 <segment> Element

   A <segment> element defines the value of the memory space in the attribute `space', which shall apply to
   all data elements within, and the value of `origin', which shall be considered as the address of a data
   element of size 0 (zero) at the beginning of the <segment>3.

   A configuration tool may, but is not required to, perform visual separation of the contents of different
   segments by appropriate UI elements, such as tabs, boxes or horizontal bars.

   A <segment> element shall contain an optional user-readable name and optional description tags, and a
   sequence of zero or more data elements. The user-readable name and description are intended as hints for
   optional UI display by configuration tools. An optional <link> sub-element can provide an optional
    hyperlink to additional information.

  5.1.4 Data Elements

   The following elements are considered data elements: <group>, <int>, <string>, <eventid>, <float>.

   The value of the address within the segment is accumulated during a depth-first traversal of the
   contents of the segment definition element.  The address is initialized with the value of the attribute
   `origin' on the <segment> element.  Each time an offset attribute is encountered, the value of the
   address is incremented by the offset (which may be negative) before any other processing of the element
   is done.  If the element defines a variable, the variable is located at the current address, and the
   address is then incremented by the size of that variable before advancing to the next element. This is
   formalized as follows.

   For each data element the following values are defined:

     * Space, which is defined by the enclosing <segment> element.

     * Address, which is defined as the end address of the previous data element plus the value of the
       attribute `offset' on the data element.

     * Size (in bytes)

     * End address, which is defined as address + size, unless otherwise specified.

   The data element’s <name> and <description> elements and the <group> element’s <repname> element are
   intended as hints for optional UI display by configuration tools.  

    5.1.4.1 <group> Element

   The <group> element allows logical grouping of variables, providing common documentation for them, and
   making multiple copies of the contained variables. CDI implementors may, but are not required to, use
   this feature to express configuration of repeated hardware or software components (such as multiple
   input ports, output ports etc).

   A <group> element shall contain an optional user-readable name, optional description, optional link
   information, optional display hints, optional replication-name information, and a sequence of zero or
   more data elements. This sequence is considered to contain a data element of size 0 (zero) before the
   specified data elements3.

   If the `replication' attribute is present with the value of N, then the group shall be considered as if
   the entire sequence of data elements were repeated N times.

   The optional <link> sub-element can provide an optional  hyperlink to additional information.

   The optional <hints> sub-element provides hints to a configuration tool on how it might best display the
   integer variable.  No specific behavior is required by the presence of this element. Available
   sub-elements for the <hints> element are <visibility> and <readOnly>.

     * <visibility> has attributes “hideable” and “hidden” that recommend whether the group be displayed in
       a form that the user can hide, and recommend whether the group is initially displayed as hidden.

     * <readOnly>, if present, recommends that the contents of the group be considered to be read-only
       values which cannot be written.

   The end address of a <group> element is defined as the end address of the last data element in the
   contained sequence (after replication). The size of a <group> element is defined as the end address
   minus the address of the <group> element.

   Configuration Tools shall not render a <group> element with no child elements4 on their UI.

    5.1.4.2 <int> Element

   The <int> element defines a variable of integer value.

   The size of the <int> element is defined as the value of the `size' attribute in bytes. Valid values are
   1, 2, 4 and 8 bytes.

   The integer value shall be stored as an unsigned integer unless a <min> sub-element with a value less
   that zero is present, in which case the integer value shall be stored as a signed integer. The integer
   value shall be written to the bytes pointed to in big-endian byte order. All bytes shall be written.

   Values smaller than defined by the <min> or larger than defined by the <max> sub-element, if present,
   are invalid and shall not be written. The default value of the <min> sub-element is zero, and the
   default value of the <max> sub-element is the largest possible value for the given size.

   If the <map> enumeration sub-element is present, then values not present in the list of <property>
   entries of the enumeration are invalid and shall not be written.

   The optional <hints> sub-element provides hints to a configuration tool on how it might best display the
   integer variable.  No specific behavior is required by the presence of this element. Available
   sub-elements for the <hints> element are <slider>, <radiobutton> and <checkbox>.

     * <slider> hints that the configuration tool should present the variable value as a slider between the
       min and max values.  

          * The optional “tickSpacing” attribute recommends a value for the spacing between tick marks on
            the slider.  

          * The optional “immediate” attribute recommends that the slider value be written to the node’s
            configuration memory immediately when the slider value is changed, without waiting for a
            “Write” button to be pressed.

          * The optional “showValue” attribute recommends that the Configuration Tool show the decimal
            slider value somewhere near the slider on the display.

     * <radiobutton> hints that the configuration tool should present the variable value as a set of radio
       buttons corresponding to the <property> elements in the associated <map> element. The <map> element
       must be present.

     * <checkbox> hints that the configuration tool should present the variable value as a checkbox. The
       unchecked value corresponds to the first <property> element in the associated <map> element.  The
       checked value corresponds to the second <property> element in the associated <map> element. The
       <map> element must be present. It is an error if there are not exactly two map entries present.

    5.1.4.3 <string> Element

   The <string> element defines a variable holding a UTF-8 string that is user-readable.

   The size of the <string> element is defined as the value of the `size' attribute in bytes.

   The string value shall be written to the bytes pointed to, starting at the address of the <string>
   element, with at least one trailing 0 (null) byte.

   If the <map> enumeration is present, then values not present in the list of <property> entries of the
   enumeration are invalid and shall not be written.

    5.1.4.4 <eventid> Element

   The <eventid> element defines a variable holding an 8-byte value representing an event ID.

   The size of the <eventid> element is defined as 8 bytes.

   The event ID shall be written to the bytes pointed to in big-endian byte order (most significant byte
   first).

   If the <map> enumeration is present, then values not present in the list of <property> entries of the
   enumeration are invalid and shall not be written.

    5.1.4.5 <float> Element

   The <float> element defines a variable of floating point value.

   The size of the <float> element is defined as the value of the `size' attribute in bytes. Valid values
   are 2, 4, and 8 bytes. The format of the bits within the element shall follow the IEEE format of the
   corresponding size.

   The floating point value shall be written to the bytes pointed to in big-endian byte order. All bytes
   shall be written.

   Values smaller than defined by the <min> or larger than defined by the <max> sub-element, if present,
   are invalid and shall not be written. The default value of the <min> sub-element is zero, and the
   default value of the <max> sub-element is the largest possible value for the given size.

   If the <map> enumeration is present, then values not present in the list of <property> entries of the
   enumeration are invalid and shall not be written.

   The optional “floatFormat” attribute defines a preferred, but not mandatory, printf-style format for
   displaying the data to the user.

    5.1.4.6 <action> Element

   The <action> element defines a write-only variable that causes the target node to perform some specific
   action. It may be linked to e.g. a button in the GUI.

   The size of the <action> element is defined as the value of the `size' attribute in bytes. Valid values
   are 1, 2, 4, and 8 bytes.

   The optional <buttonText> sub-element, when present, is a hint to the rendering code about what should
   appear in the user interface e.g, as the text on the button that triggers the action’s write operation.
   Note that no specific behavior is required.

   The optional <dialogText> sub-element, when non-blank, suggests to the GUI that it would be good to
   provide an additional warning to the user before triggering the action’s write operation.  This could be
   done by e.g. presenting an OK/Confirm dialog with the dialogText value. A blank or not-present value for
   the element is a hint that no additional warning is requested. Note that no specific behavior is
   required.

   The required <value> sub-element is the specific decimal value to be written when the action is
   triggered.

   The write-only variable defined by the <action> element must not be written other than when the action
   is to be triggered.

    5.1.4.7 <blob> Element

   The <blob> element defines a region of memory that a GUI can transfer to an external file (“read”),
   transfer from an external file (“write”) or both (“readwrite”).

   The required size and optional offset attributes define a ten-byte section of memory containing:

     * 1 byte operation flag;

     * 5 bytes of a memory space followed by a four-byte address of the memory blob;

     * 4 bytes of length of the memory blob.

   To read the blob data:

     * Write a value of 1 to the operation flag location.

     * Read the memory space and address of the memory blob.

     * Read the length of the memory blob.

     * Use the Memory Configuration Protocol to read the data.

   To write the blob data:

     * Write a value of 1 to the operation flag location.

     * Read the memory space and address of the memory blob.

     * Write the length of the data to be written.  The node being configured will positively acknowledge
       this write if the data can be accepted, and negatively acknowledge it if the data can’t be accepted.

     * Use the Memory Configuration protocol to write the data.

                                        6 Future Extension (Normative)

   Configuration tools implementing a future version of this Standard must be able to process CDI content
   defined according to any earlier version of the Standard, including this version.

   Configuration tools implementing major version 1 of this Standard may assume the following about future
   minor versions of this Standard:

     * No existing tags will change the interpretation or default value of the `offset' and `size'
       attribute, and accordingly the address and size value, the data type and encoding of the value in
       the memory space. The <group> tag will not change the interpretation of the `offset' attribute and
       `replication' attribute.

     * All unknown tags that occur within the element <segment> or <group> and have an attribute `size'
       shall be considered to be data elements with address defined as the end eddress of the previous data
       element plus the value of the `offset' attribute, and size defined as the value of the `size'
       attribute in bytes. The `size' attribute of all future data elements shall be required.

   No assumptions may be made about major version 2 and up of this Standard.
