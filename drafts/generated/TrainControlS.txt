                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This Standard covers the Train Control Protocol, the way that OpenLCB handles moving objects such as
   locomotives, engines, and other rolling stock.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   The Train Control Protocol covers the interaction between one (or more) Throttles and one or more
   Trains, as this interaction is represented on the OpenLCB bus. There can be more than one Throttles
   controlling a single Train, and more than one Trains being controlled by a single Throttle (also called
   consisting). The Throttle, as a Node on the OpenLCB bus, may be either a physical throttle, or a Gateway
   converting messages of a different throttle protocol to OpenLCB. The Train is also represented as a Node
   on the OpenLCB bus; this may be a physical decoder present in a locomotive and capable of participating
   in the OpenLCB network (presumably via wireless communication), or it may be a Gateway device
   translating the OpenLCB Train Control Protocol to some other method of controlling trains. The most
   important example of such other method is the DCC track protocol, in which case the Gateway device is
   commonly referred to as a DCC Command Station.

   For more information on format and presentation, see:

     * OpenLCB Common Information Technical Note.

   For information on OpenLCB message transport and OpenLCB communications, see:

     * OpenLCB Message Network Standard.

   A Node implementing the Train Control Protocol must implement:

     * OpenLCB Event Transport Standard;

     * OpenLCB Simple Node Information Protocol Standard.

   The following protocols are strongly recommended to be implemented by any Train node:

     * OpenLCB Memory Configuration Standard and Datagram Protocol it depends on;

     * OpenLCB Configuration Description Information Standard;

     * OpenLCB Function Description Information Standard;

     * OpenLCB Train Search Protocol.

   Float-16 is the half-precision numeric format defined by IEEE 754-2008. This is the format that the GNU
   toolchain's -mfp16-format=ieee flag and __fp16 type makes available on some CPU types.

3.1 Terminology

   The following Nodes participate in the interactions presented in this Standard:

     * Train Node: A Train is represented by a single, specific Node. To control that specific Train,
       OpenLCB messages are sent addressed to that Node. It is not a requirement that the hardware
       operating the given Train Node be mechanically installed in the specific Train.

     * Throttle Node: An OpenLCB Node controlling one or more Train Nodes using the Train Control Protocol.
       It is not a requirement that the hardware operating the Throttle Node be mechanically installed into
       the physical throttle that the operator is using. A single OpenLCB Node may have independent
       interactions with multiple Train Nodes, and thus represent more than one physical throttle.

   The following additional concepts are used:

     * Train Control Operation: The set of commands Set Speed, Emergency Stop and Set Function.

     * Controller: A Train Node has zero or one Throttle Node assigned as the Controller. There is no
       requirement that the Train Node should accept Train Control Operations from the Controller only. A
       Throttle Node set as the Controller has to stay alive and connected to the OpenLCB bus, and the
       Train Node may periodically verify this as a safety check.

     * Listener: A Throttle Node may be interested in receiving a copy of all state changing messages from
       a given Train Node. Since Throttle-to-Train configuration is addressed, there is no network-level
       mechanism to guarantee that messages destined to the Train Node can be intercepted by the interested
       third party. The Train Node therefore has a feature that allows other nodes to be registered, and
       the Train shall forward the speed (and optionally function) setting messages to the registered
       Listener nodes. A way to achieve consisting is to specify the consist members as listeners on the
       lead engine's train node, or to allocate a virtual node and specify all engines as listeners to that
       virtual node.

   The Set Function instruction uses a three-byte address for brevity; it's to be interpreted with a high
   byte of zero to make a four byte address in the function memory space (0xF9).

   The P bit shall be set to 0 when a Throttle Node sends a command to a Train Node, and set to 1 when a
   Train Node is sending a forwarded command to a Listener Node.

   The Query Speed/Direction reply is almost in the Set Speed/Direction format, with the addition of the
   two additional speeds.  If a node cannot provide any of those three speeds, it shall use float16 NaN
   (not a number) 0xFFFF. “Set Speed” is the most recent speed received in a Set Speed/Direction
   instruction, or ±0 if an E-Stop command was received after the last Set Speed/Direction command. The
   E-Stop bit in the Flags byte represents whether the Train Node is in Emergency Stop state. “Commanded
   Speed” is the speed that the train is currently attempting to move, taking into account momentum and any
   other control modifiers.  “Actual Speed” is the current measured speed of the locomotive. There is no
   accuracy guarantee for Actual Speed.

                                             5 States (Normative)

   OpenLCB Train Nodes have the following states:

   Related to Speed:

     * Set Speed – The speed set by a throttle, the content of the most recent “set speed” instruction

     * Commanded Speed – the current speed that is intended by the control algorithm of the Train Node.
       Optional (assumed to match the Set Speed when not implemented).

     * Current Speed – a physical state, the speed at which the object is currently moving. Optional
       (assumed to match the Commanded Speed when not implemented).

   Related to Emergency Stop:

     * A Train Node enters Emergency Stop state upon receiving a Train Control Command message with
       Emergency Stop command. A Train Node leaves Emergency Stop state upon receiving a Train Control
       Command message with a Set Speed command (for any speed, including ±0).

     * A Train Node enters Global Emergency Stop state upon receiving an Event Report message with the
       Emergency Stop All event. A Train Node leaves Global Emergency Stop state upon receiving an Event
       Report message with the Clear Emergency Stop All event.

     * A Train Node enters Global Emergency Off state upon receiving an Event Report message with the
       Emergency Off All event. A Train Node leaves Global Emergency Off state upon receiving an Event
       Report message with the Clear Emergency Off All event.

   Related to Functions:

     * It is not specified, which Function numbers are part of the state of the Train Node, and for those
       that are, what resolution the value needs to be represented.

   Related to Listeners:

     * The state consists of which Listeners are currently attached (their Node ID), the Flag byte with
       which they were last attached, and the order in which they were attached. Updating the flags shall
       not change the order.

     * It is strongly recommended to store the Listener configuration in persistent state.

   Related to Controller:

     * The state consists of a single Node ID, which may be unset.

                                          6 Interactions (Normative)

6.1 Controller

   A Train Node maintains a single Node ID in its state as the Controller. A Throttle Node, before
   attempting any Train Control Operation, shall assign its own Node ID as the Train Node’s Controller. A
   Throttle Node which is the current Controller, before intentionally powering down, shall attempt to
   release itself from the Train Node.

   A Train Node may, but is not required to, reject all Train Control Operations from an OpenLCB Node that
   is not the current Controller. In such a case the Terminate Due To Error message shall be used with the
   error code “source not permitted – not a controller”. Messages arriving from an attached Listener with
   the P bit set to 1 shall never be rejected.

   A Train Node may, but is not required to, use heartbeats (see Section Heartbeat) to ensure that the
   Controller is continuously present on the network and is intending to keep the control of the
   locomotive.

   A Throttle Node, to assign itself as the Controller of a Train Node, sends a Train Control Command
   message to the Train Node, with the Controller Configuration – Assign Controller command and its own
   Node ID. To accept the request, the Train Node shall set the Controller to the provided Node ID and
   reply with a Train Control Reply with a Controller Configuration – Assign Controller Reply with a Result
   of 0. A result of non-zero rejects the request. If there was a previous Controller, the Train Node sends
   a Controller Changing Notify Request to the previous Controller. The Train Node may, but is not required
   to wait for the reply of the previous Controller and factor in its reply to the decision. The Train Node
   shall reply to the Assign Controller message within 3 seconds.

   A Node may query the active Controller from a Train Node.  If no Controller is assigned the Train Node
   returns a Node ID of 0.0.0.0.0.0.

   A Throttle Node assigned as a Controller of a Train Node, to release itself as the active Controller,
   sends a Controller Configuration – Release Controller request with its own Node ID to the Train Node.
   The Train Node shall verify that the Node ID matches the current Controller before setting the
   Controller to empty.

6.2 Emergency Stop

   Receipt of the Emergency Stop instruction stops the locomotive as fast as possible.  This sets the Set
   Speed to zero (preserving existing direction) and the Commanded Speed to zero (preserving existing
   direction) regardless of any momentum, BEMF or other operations with the train node.

   Entering the Global Emergency Stop or Global Emergency Off state also stops the locomotive as fast as
   possible, but does not change the Set Speed. The train shall remain stopped while it is in any of the
   Emergency Stop, Global Emergency Stop or Global Emergency Off states. Upon exiting all Emergency Stop
   states, the locomotive shall accelerate to the currently valid Set Speed, if that is not zero, according
   to its settings.

   In addition to stopping movement, the Global Emergency Off state shall de-energize all other outputs of
   the Train Node if possible. Upon exiting Global Emergency Off, these shall then be restored to their
   commanded state, which may have changed during the period of the Global Emergency Off state.

6.3 Function Operation

   Function values are stored in the 0xF9 memory space. They are written using the memory configuration
   protocol or using the Set Function instruction.

   For a binary function the Throttle Node shall write the value ‘0’ to turn the function off, and ‘1’ to
   turn the function on.

6.4 Train Identification

   Train Nodes shall be producers of the well-known reserved event ‘Is Train’ according to the OpenLCB
   Event Transport Standard.

6.5 Listeners

   When listeners are configured on a Train Node, the incoming Train Control Operations are forwarded by
   the Train Node to all the Listener nodes. The forwarded message shall be a Train Control Request message
   with the bit P set to 1.

   Even if the source node of the incoming message is on the listener list, the message is not forwarded to
   the source node to avoid message loops.

   The listener flags define which messages shall be forwarded:

     * Set speed message is always forwarded. If the flag “Rev direction” is set for the listener, the
       direction of the forwarded speed is flipped.

     * Set function message with function number = 0 shall be forwarded if and only if the “Link F0” flag
       is set on the listener configuration.

     * Set function message for any other function number shall be forwarded if and only if the “Link Fn”
       flag is set on the listener configuration.

   To add or remove a listener, the Attach Node or Detach Node message shall be sent to the target Train
   Node. The response shall contain the same node ID and a 2-byte OpenLCB Error Code. The following error
   codes may be helpful:

     * 0x0000: Success.

     * Permanent error, Not found. Useful if the caller tried to remove a node that is not attached as a
       Listener.

     * Permanent error, Already Exists. Useful if the caller tried to add a node as a Listener to itself.

   If a caller wants to update the flags of a specific listener, the Attach Node message shall be sent with
   the same node ID and the new flags.

   To query the listeners from a train node, a Listener configuration Query Nodes message shall be sent to
   the train node. The response message contains the number of listeners currently configured. Listeners
   are indexed from 0 to count-1. Sending the Query Nodes message with the index specified, the train node
   will return the information for that specific listener, including Node ID and the flags specifying the
   forwarding options. If the requested index is out of bounds, or no index is requested, then the response
   will be short (no node information).

   User interfaces that show the listeners shall not show listener nodes that are marked with the flag
   “Hide”. This flag is intended to be set for controlling throttles and train automation systems.

   A Train Node may, but is not required to change its state upon a received Set Function message with P=1.
   Whether or not it changes state, the forwarding of the message to other Listeners is required as
   specified above.

6.6 Heartbeat

   The Heartbeat Request may be sent by a Train Node to the currently active Controller node at the
   discretion of the Train Node.  The argument is a deadline in seconds for the Controller node to reply.
   The Controller node may reply with any control or query command, or a No-op command.

   Trains shall not initiate a Heartbeat Request if the last Set Speed is zero (including when the Train
   Node is in Emergency Stop state).

   Trains shall accept any command or query sent from the Controller node to the Train Node to clear the
   Heartbeat Request. If the Controller node does not have anything to command or query, the Train Control
   Management No-op request may be used to clear the Heartbeat.

   If a Train Node does not receive any command or query from the Controller node within the deadline
   presented in the Heartbeat Request, the Train Node shall interpret that as a Set Speed 0 command. This
   command shall be forwarded to all registered Listeners at the same time, including the Controller node,
   if it is registered as a Listener.

   In case there is no assigned Controller node, the Train Node shall continue operating as last commanded.

                                         7 Memory Spaces (Normative)

7.1 Function Information 0xF9

   Functions, such as lights and sounds, can be operated by the Train Control Set Function instruction, and
   their current value can be retrieved via the Train Control Query Function instruction. The values are
   also available for reading and writing in the Function Information memory space, so long as the value of
   a given function does not exceed 255.

   The NMRA S-9.2.1 Standard describes four separate DCC packets controlling sets of “functions”. The
   OpenLCB 0xF9 space is allocated to cover all these by using the third byte of the address as a selector.

   Type                       Low Address High Address Values                           
                                                       A non-zero value indicates "ON", 
   F0-F68                     0x0 00 00   0x0 00 44                                     
                                                       a zero value is "OFF".           
   Binary State Controls                                                                
                              0x1 00 00   0x1 7F FF    "
   (full space)               
   Binary State Controls                                                                
                              0x2 00 00   0x2 00 7F    "
   (short space, if separate) 
   Analog Outputs             0x3 00 00   0x3 00 FF                                     

   A Train Node representing a DCC locomotive may, but is not required to provide support for all of the
   above features, and it may, but is not required to provide the last written data upon a read command.

7.2 Function Definition Information (FDI) 0xFA

   0xFA is a read-only memory space which provides information for Throttle Nodes on how to present a user
   interface to control the specific functions that are available on this particular Train Node.

   The format and semantics of this data is specified by the OpenLCB Function Definition Information
   Standard.
