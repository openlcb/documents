                                                1 Introduction

   This working note covers the Traction Protocol, the way that OpenLCB handles moving objects such as
   locomotives, engines, and other rolling stock.

   A Working Note is an intermediate step in the documentation process.  It gathers together the content
   from various informal development documents, discussions, etc into a single place.  One or more Working
   Notes form the basic for the next step, which is one or more Standard/TechNote pairs.

   This protocol is for the long-term operation of really cool trains, not just “better control over DCC”.
    Still, DCC is an important test case, both with new control hardware (OpenLCB native throttles
   connected to an OpenLCB-native command station that's generating the DCC signal) and when connected to
   legacy throttles and/or command stations.  Using legacy hardware within the OpenLCB environment is
   accomplished through a proxy and is implemented using this Traction Protocol and the Traction Proxy
   Protocol.

1.1 Terminology

   “DCC” refers to NMRA DCC; “Legacy” refers to all pre-existing protocols including DCC, TMCC, Marklin,
   DCS, etc.

   “Trains”: For our purposes, Train is anything which can be independently controlled. In addition to a
   model of a prototype train from locomotive to caboose, it might be just single caboose, a set of lit &
   controlled passenger cars, a diesel MU lash up, or basically anything that can take an OpenLCB "decoder"
   or a DCC decoder with a legacy attachment.

   “Train Node”: A Train is associated with a single, specific node. The Node ID is the fully-unique
   identifier for that Train.

   “Throttles”: For the purposes of discussion, we draw a distinction between three kinds of throttles that
   a user might encounter:

     * “Legacy Throttles” refers to throttles designed for use with extant DCC systems, e.g. a Digitrax
       DT402 or Lenz LH100.

     * “Full-Featured Throttles” refers to full-featured native OpenLCB throttles with multi-line color
       screens and effectively unlimited processing power, e.g. a software throttle implemented on an iPad.

     * “Simple Throttles” refers to throttles which are native OpenLCB nodes like Full-Featured Throttles,
       but which have more limited capabilities, e.g. no text display, a limited array of physical buttons,
       and constrained processing resources.

   “Proxies”: In the long term, we expect that OpenLCB protocols will go all the way to the train. This has
   great advantages, because you're always in complete communication with the train, and don't have to
   worry about only being able to configure the train when it's on a service track, storing information
   somewhere else so that it can be retrieved while the train is moving, etc. But until radio or other
   technologies mature to the point that this is possible, "proxies" can be used as stand-ins for that
   capability. A throttle might communicate with a node that's serving as a proxy for the train, handling
   the communications, keeping track of status & configuration, etc. Out the back end of that proxy node is
   some other kind of communications, perhaps direct DCC or a connection to a legacy system that in turn
   makes DCC signals, or some other technology entirely. Due to the nature of those back side
   communications methods, the proxy may not be able to do everything that OpenLCB can, or only do some of
   it at certain times. The OpenLCB traction protocols need to take this reality into account.  Another use
   case for proxies, discussed in detail below, is to provide the mechanism for consisting.

   “Command Stations”: Existing DCC and other control systems use “command stations” to create a track
   signal for controlling the trains. Usually the command station is controlled from the user side by some
   other network, to which throttles and other interface devices are connected. OpenLCB, it it's native
   form, has no such concept. Devices, like throttles, that want to talk to a train do so directly. Only
   when working with legacy systems does the concept of a command station enter, and usually through the
   form of a proxy node that is acting for the Train.

   “Consisting”: The running of multiple items together, e.g. three coupled engines, each with their own
   NodeID or DCC address, as a single locomotive. DCC systems provide this now in various ways and with
   various names.

   “Listener”: A node may be interested in receiving a copy of all state changing messages from a given
   train node. Since throttle-to-train configuration is addressed, there is no network-level mechanism to
   guarantee that messages destined to the train node can be intercepted by the interested third party. The
   train node therefore may have a feature that allows other nodes to be registered, and the train shall
   forward the speed (and optionally function) setting messages to the registered nodes. A way to achieve
   consisting is to specify the consist members as listeners on the lead engine's train node, or to
   allocate a virtual node and specify all engines as listeners to that virtual node.

   “Configuration”, “Functions”: Traditional DCC decoders provide “functions” for controlling accessories
   such as lights and sounds during operation, and provide a separate mechanism for doing long-term
   configuration via Configuration Variables (Cvs). OpenLCB makes the same distinction, providing access to
   “functions” via the traction protocol, while leaving “configuration” to the configuration protocol(s).
    The line between these is admittedly vague, and different node developers may implement some capability
   one way or the other.  The general intent is that things that are changed in normal operation are
   considered functions, while things that are set once and forgotten are configuration.

1.2 Served Use Cases

  1.2.1 Train Operation

   Bill hasn't run his passenger train recently on his OpenLCB-equipped layout. He picks up a throttle,
   hits a few keys, sees his passenger train listed, selects it and starts to run it. Some configuration
   needs tweaking (e.g. volume too low), so he enters a configuration dialog on the throttle, finds the
   right item by reading through them, changes the value to be a few larger, and stores that back into the
   train as it's running on the main track. That makes it work immediately.

  1.2.2 Large Modular Layout

   Arnold has put his OpenLCB-equipped train on a large modular layout, where it is one of 500 pieces of
   equipment. He picks up a throttle, presses a few keys, sees his train, selects it and starts to operate
   it.

  1.2.3 Train on New Layout

   Jim takes his OpenLCB-equipped train to Bill's OpenLCB-equipped layout and puts it on the track. He
   picks up a throttle, hits a few keys, sees his train, selects it and starts to run it. On this layout,
   some configuration needs tweaking (e.g. volume too low), so he enters a configuration dialog on the
   throttle, finds the right item by reading through them, changes the value to be a few larger, and stores
   that back into the train. That makes it work. When he gets back home that value is still present so he
   changes it back using the same procedure.

1.3 Unserved Use Cases

  1.3.1 Third-Party Communications

   Node A is a throttle that is controlling train node B.  Node C passively listens to the traffic and
   reacts to throttle commands and train status by taking various actions, such as providing appropriate
   sounds or preventing the speed from getting too high.

                                             2 Specified Sections

   This is the usual section organization for a Technical Note, to accumulate the Standard and Technical
   Note content in its eventual order.

2.1 Introduction

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

2.2 Intended Use

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

2.3 Reference and Context

   Node implementing the Train Protocol must implement:

     * Message Transfer Protocol

     * Event Transfer Protocol

     * Memory Configuration Protocol (optional?) and Datagram Protocol it depends on

     * CDI

     * SNII and/or ACDI?

   Float-16 is the half-precision numeric format defined by IEEE 754-2008. This is the format that the GNU
   tool chain's -mfp16-format=ieee flag and __fp16 type makes available on some CPU types.

2.4 Message Formats

   AA.AA refers to an NMRA short or long address in the format defined by the NMRA. (Say a few words about
   short addresses in two bytes, maybe give examples)

  2.4.1 Defined Event IDs

    

   IsTrain: 01.01.00.00.00.00.03.03

   EmergencyStopAll: 01.01.00.00.00.00.FF.FF

  2.4.2 Traction Control Command Message

   MTI: Priority 1, index 15, modifier 3, addressed => MTI 0x05EB, CAN frame [195EBsss] fd dd

   The MTI modifiers are chosen to have the reply a higher priority than the request, ensuring replies to
   repeated instructions are always possible.  The same priority and index are used for command and reply
   messages, changing only the modifier, to use less of the high-priority MTI space which is a scarce
   resource.

   This message type and MTI is specific to traction control.  The first byte of the content codes an
   “instruction”, which defines the rest of the format.

   Dedicated OpenLCB messages are defined for traction control, instead of using datagrams, so that they
   have higher priority. Given the small size of these messages, they also use less bandwidth than
   datagrams.

   The Set Function instruction uses a three-byte address for brevity; it's to be interpreted with a high
   byte of zero to make a four byte address in the function memory space (0xFA).

   There's no reply defined to Set Speed and Set Function to reduce bandwidth use.  OpenLCB is a
   reliable-transport network, so these replies are not required for reliability.  Train nodes must be able
   to receive and process them at full rate, as they can arrive adjacent to each other on the link.

   The Query Speed/Direction reply is almost in the Set Speed/Direction format, with the addition of the
   two additional speeds.  If a node cannot provide any of those three speeds, it should use float16 NaN
   (not a number) 0xFFFF. “Set Speed” is the most recent speed received in a Set Speed/Direction
   instruction, or ±0 if an E-Stop command was received after the last Set Speed/Direction command.
   “Commanded Speed” is the speed that the traction control is currently attempting to move, taking into
   account momentum and any other control modifiers.  “Actual Speed” is the current measured speed of the
   locomotive. There is no accuracy guarantee for Actual Speed.

   On CAN, the Query Speed/Direction reply does not fit in a single frame, so it's sent as two frames with
   start and end marked in the 1st data nibble (high part of destination address). The status byte was
   included so that the actual speed value would not be split across boundaries (though that's not
   necessarily guaranteed for other wire protocols that come along later). The status byte is is a bit set.
   Bit zero shall be set if and only if an Emergency Stop command was received after the last Set
   Speed/Direction command. For example, from node with alias 123 to node with alias 456, all speeds equal
   to 0x4420 would be sent as the two frames:

   195EB123 14 56 10 44 20 00 44 20

   195EB123 24 56 44 20

   which together are the single message

   MTI=05EB 10 44 20 00 44 20 44 20

   Controller configuration maintains the node that is controlling the train node. In order to operate a
   train the controller must be first assigned.  A train node shall not respond to a traction message if it
   not defined as the current active Controller.  Once a controller is finished operating a train it
   should, but is not required, to Release the active Controller.  One place this may not be done is if the
   controller is being unplugged to be moved to a new location on the layout.  The benefit of releasing the
   train is to allow the next controller to be connected to the train without the handshaking required to
   take a train from an existing active Controller.  This is explained in the messaging diagram later in
   this document.  A Controller node may be send an unsolicited message if it is currently assigned to a
   train node and another Controller node attempts to assign itself to the train.  The when new the
   Controller node requests to be Assigned to the train one of several actions may occur.

    1. The train may block the request and return false to the Assign request

    2. The train forwards a Controller Changed Notify message to the currently assigned controller node and
       that controller node returns false in which the train node returns false with a fail code of
       Controller Refused to the Assign request.  The active controller may, but is not required to,
       indicate to the user it has been asked to release the train node.

    3. The train forwards a Controller Changed Notify message to the currently assigned controller node and
       that controller node return true.  The active controller may, but is not required to, indicate to
       the user it is loosing its position as the active controller of the train node.  In turn the train
       node returns true to the Assign request and the train node sets the new controller as the active
       controller.

   A node may Query the active node from a train node.  If no controller is assigned the train nodes
   returns a Node ID of 0.0.0.0.0.0.  It would be better to return an error code but that would require a
   multi-frame message which is possible but undesirable.

   Listener Configuration allows adding listeners to a train node, where the train node shall forward the
   state-changing requests to. Listeners always get speed change commands forwarded (direct or with
   reversed direction), and optionally Function 0 or all function commands as well.

   Traction Management locks/releases the train node such that interactions that require multiple messages
   between 2 or more nodes are guaranteed to be completed before another node can set (modify) the
   configuration on the train node.  These messages are not needed for normal traction operations such as
   speed and function set/query.  If the node attempting to set attributes of the train is not the active
   node the train node will ignore the request and as such locking/releasing is not required.

   The Heartbeat Request may be sent by a train node to the currently active Controller node at the
   discretion of the train node.  The argument is a deadline in seconds for the Controller node to reply.
   The Controller node may reply with any control or query command, or a No-op command. If there is no
   command received within the deadline, the train node may elect to stop the train.

2.5 States

   Full OpenLCB nodes:

     * Set Speed – The speed set by a throttle, the content of the most recent “set speed” instruction

     * Commanded Speed – the current speed that is intended.  This may lag behind the set speed
       intentionally due to momentum settings, etc.

     * Current Speed – a physical state, the speed at which the object is currently moving

   Emergency stop is not a state.

2.6 Memory Spaces

  2.6.1 Configuration Information

   The configuration memory space holds the configuration of the train, such as how functions will work,
   how speed in scale meters/second will control motor operation, etc.

  2.6.2 CDI

  2.6.3 Function Information 0xF9

   Functions, such as lights and sounds, can be operated by the Traction Control Set Function instruction,
   and their current value can be retrieved via the Traction Control Query Function instruction. The values
   are also available for reading and writing in the Function Information memory space.  This allows
   multi-byte reads and writes using Configuration Memory Protocol access. That's a more efficient way of
   setting and reading large numbers of functions, for backup, initial setup, etc.

   The NMRA 9.2.1 Recommended Practice describes DCC as having three separate sets of "functions". The most
   common one is the traditional F0-F28. In addition, the "Binary State Control Instruction long form"
   accesses 32767 addresses (confusingly called "states" in the NMRA doc) and the "Binary State Control
   Instruction short form" accessed 127 addresses (the NMRA document implies that these are overlapping
   address spaces, but at least one manufacturer has not implemented them that way). Finally, NMRA DCC WG
   Topic 9910241 never made it to the Recommended Practices due to internal Working Group politics, but has
   been widely implemented by decoder and command station manufacturers. It provides an "Analog Output
   Instruction" or "Analog Function Group" with 8 bits of address space and 8 bits of value for each
   address, for a total of 256 functions and a value in the range [0..255] for each function.

    The OpenLCB 0xF9 space is allocated to cover all these by using the third byte of the address as a
   selector.

   Type                       Low Address High Address Values                           
                                                       A non-zero value indicates "ON", 
   F0-F28                     0x0 00 00   0x0 00 1C                                     
                                                       a zero value is "OFF".           
   Binary State Controls                                                                
                              0x1 00 00   0x1 7F FF    "
   (full space)               
   Binary State Controls                                                                
                              0x2 00 00   0x2 00 7F    "
   (short space, if separate) 
   Analog Outputs             0x3 00 00   0x3 00 FF                                     

   The default Function Definition Information, when nothing is known about a particular decoder's
   capabilities, will just describe these as above. If the node serving the DCC decoder information knows
   more about the particular decoder's capabilities and/or preferred labeling, it can provide more
   information via the Function Definition Information.

   There's nothing in the standard that says that the first three types of information need to be stored in
   29+32768+128 bytes.  Packing them into bits is certainly acceptable, given that the underlying DCC
   protocol can only send one bit for each. An individual node may not implement all of them, either.

  2.6.4 Function Definition Information FDI 0xFA

   “Function Definition Information”, similar in intent to Configuration Definition Information (CDI) is
   stored in XML format in address space 0xFA to provide user-oriented context. That includes:

     * Memory layout of the function values, allowing for multiple data types from binary (one and off for
       lights) through integer values (for e.g. sound intensities) and strings (sign displays?).

     * Function naming, so that a throttle can display useful names to the user such as "Bell", "Coupler
       Clank" and "Master Volume". This includes internationalization of those labels.

   What else needs to be conveyed? "Make this prominent on the throttle"? "Have this there, just a little
   less prominent"? "Seriously, nobody cares about this option, bury it"?

   At present, there are no default values that e.g. associate "Bell" with a particular location or
   function. These are thought to be too brittle, and there are just too many possibilities to be useful
   (see the unscientific and incomplete Survey of existing function names).

2.7 Interactions

  2.7.1 Emergency Stop

   Receipt of the Emergency Stop instruction stops the locomotive as fast as possible.  This sets the set
   speed to zero (preserving existing direction) and the commanded speed to zero (preserving existing
   direction) regardless of any momentum, BEMF or other operations with the train node.

   Emergency stop is not specific state.  The next Set Speed/Direction instruction will act immediately to
   change the set speed, and start the commanded speed and actual speed moving toward that set speed.

  2.7.2 Function Operation

   Function values are stored in the 0xF9 memory space. They are written using the memory configuration
   protocol or using the Set Function instruction.

  2.7.3 Train Configuration

   Trains are OpenLCB nodes just like any other. As such, the Memory Configuration protocol can be used to
   configure them, the Configuration Description Information system can be used to make that process user
   friendly, etc. There's nothing traction-specific in these techniques, which are available any time that
   the train node is connected to the OpenLCB.

   The configuration information in a train can include the user documentation that's sometimes referred to
   as "roster information". This might include owner name, prototype railroad and road number, information
   about the particular model's construction, etc. As yet, OpenLCB has no standards nor conventions on this
   information.

   One approach to standards in this area would be extend ACDI/SNIP. Those currently have a block for
   manufacturer identification, and a block for user identification. Those are both versioned. We could
   take (one of) several approaches:

     * Extend them with a third block, only present when the node implements the train protocol (as seen in
       PIP). To allow later introduction of more types, this block would have some versioning/type
       information, but that's straightforward.

     * Create a version 2 of the user block, which holds additional data. (This would be using 2 as a
       format identifier, rather than a version number; that might make versioning complicated)

   Suitable content for a (first version of) this might be (from [
   http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/roster/RosterEntry.html JMRI roster], see also similar concepts
   in [rocrail.net RocRail]):

     * Road Name

     * Road Number

   (Manufacturer, model, owner description, comments, etc are already present in ACDI/SNI)

   For DCC locomotives, more terms might be desired:

     * DCC Address

     * Decoder Type (Manufacturer, model)

    

  2.7.4 Train Identification

   OpenLCB Train nodes use:

     * The Event Transport protocol to locate Train nodes

     * PIP for enquiry about the support

     * SNII and/or Memory configuration, CDI & ACDI  for identification of a specific train node.

   Trains are OpenLCB nodes just like any other. As such, they can take part in protocols such as Node
   Verification and Simple Node Information which allows other nodes to learn about them.

   Train Acquisition Protocol is necessary because the train operator doesn't want to pick up a throttle
   and enter “06.011.00.02.1F.2D” (a node ID), or even “110 Long” (a DCC address), but rather just pick the
   desired locomotive from a list of those available. (A throttle should still allow the operator to
   directly enter the address, when that's what the operator wants to do.)

   The train acquisition process simplifies locating desired train nodes so that small hand-held throttle
   nodes can efficiently take part. It does this using several approaches, which can be used as needed by
   throttles:

     * Events are used to announce the existence and status of Train nodes

     * Train nodes will generally implement the Simple Node Information protocol so that throttles can get
       basic, user-readable identification from them

     * A search protocol is (being) defined to make it possible to locate individual Train nodes without
       having to read information from all of them

   So that other nodes can find them, Train nodes must produce the well-known reserved event
   01.01.00.00.00.00.03.03. This means they must produce that event in a Producer/Consumer Event Report
   message when they power up, and reply to requests for producers of that event. An IdentifyProducer
   request will therefore find all the train nodes on the OpenLCB, and further protocols can be used to get
   additional information on the individual Train nodes it locates.

   SNIP will be used to carry both manufacturer-provided and user-provided information about the particular
   train node. In particular, the user (Node) Name and (Node) Description fields are to be used to hold
   train identification information that can be retrieved and presented by throttles for selection.

   A search protocol maay eventually be defined to allow efficient location of specific train nodes on
   large OpenLCB installations. It provides a general or field-specific search over the SNIP information,
   returning the Node IDs of matching Train Nodes. One proposal, which is not based on memory configuration
   & SNIP, is available here in pdf format and here in OpenOffice Writ

  2.7.5 Conflicting Throttles

   graphics4

  2.7.6 Throttle to Throttle Successful Hand-over (steal)

  2.7.7 Listeners

   graphics5

   When listeners are configured, the incoming state changing traction messages are forwarded by the train
   node to all the listener nodes. The forwarded message shall be a Traction Control Request message.

   If the source node of the message is on the listener list, the message is not forwarded to avoid message
   loops.

   The listener flags define what messages shall be forwarded:

     * Set speed message is always forwarded. If the flag “Rev direction” is set for the listener, the
       direction of the forwarded speed is flipped.

     * Set function message with function number = 0 is forwarded iff the “Link F0” flag is set on the
       listener configuration.

     * Set function messages for all other function numbers shall be forwarded iff the “Link Fn” flag is
       set on the listener configuration.

   A train node may provide additional configuration, for example as part of the CDI to customize the
   forwarding of messages. This may be interesting for virtual train nodes specifically designed to be
   consist proxies.

   To add or remove a listener, the Attach Node or Detach Node message shall be sent to the target train
   node. The response shall contain the same node ID and a 2-byte OpenLCB Error Code. The following error
   codes may be helpful:

     * 0x1030: Permanent error, Not found. Useful if the caller tried to remove a node that is not attached
       as a listener.

     * 0x1032: Permanent error, Already Exists. Useful if the caller tried to add a node as a listener to
       itself.

   If a caller wants to update the flags of a specific listener, the Attach Node message shall be sent with
   the same node ID and the new flags.

   To query the listeners from a train node, a Listener configuration Query Nodes message shall be sent to
   the train node. The response message contains the number of listeners currently configured. Listeners
   are indexed from 0 to count-1. Sending the Query Nodes message with the index specified, the train node
   will return the information for that specific listener, including Node ID and the flags specifying the
   forwarding options. If the requested index is out of bounds, or no index is requested, then the response
   will be short (no node information).

   User interfaces that show the listeners shall not show listener nodes that are marked with the flag
   “Hide”. This flag is intended to be set for controlling throttles and train automation systems.

   To discover and retrieve all listeners from a train node, multiple query messages are required. This
   presents a race condition when a third node changes the listener configuration during the process. It is
   not specified how the listener indexes change by attaching or detaching a listener. The querying node
   can recognize that their information is out of date by observing a change in the count of listeners
   compared to the expected number of listeners and restart the enumeration process.

  2.7.8 Heartbeat

   Train nodes may employ a heartbeat mechanism to ensure that the assigned Controller (typically a
   throttle) is alive and in control of the train. This is a safety feature that protects valuable
   equipment from technical failures causing a runaway train rolling uncontrollably.

   The Heartbeat Request shall be initiated by the train node. This choice was made in order to allow
   centralizing the timeout based logic in one participant. It is recommended to make heartbeats a
   selectable option for a train or proxy (command station). The train shall not initiate a heartbeat
   request if it has received a command or query from the Controller node within the time period of the
   heartbeats.

   Trains shall not initiate a heartbeat request if the last Set Speed is zero (including E-stop).

   Trains shall accept any command or query sent from the controller node to the train node to clear the
   heartbeat request. If the controller node does not have anything to command or query, the Traction
   Management No-op request may be used to clear the heartbeat.

   If a train does not receive any command or query from the Controller node within the deadline presented
   in the heartbeat request, the train shall interpret that as a Set Speed 0 command. This command shall be
   forwarded to any registered listeners at the same time.

   In case there is no assigned Controller node, there is no connection to check with heartbeats, and the
   train shall continue operating as last commanded. Controllers can choose to release themselves from the
   train if they wish to not receive heartbeats; this is recommended during any orderly shutdown of a
   controller or else the train will stop after the heartbeat period.

   There are two timing parameters in the Heartbeat interaction, which may be specified separately by the
   manufacturer of the train node or the configuration of the user.

     * The time period of heartbeats: the maximum idle period after which a heartbeat is sent.

     * The deadline: after a heartbeat is sent, how much time does the Controller have to reply.

   The suggested default values are 10 seconds for period and 3 seconds for deadline. It is recommended for
   manufacturers to make the period configurable by the user.

   Alerter mode. The Standard purposefully does not specify that a Controller shall automatically clear the
   heartbeat request. It is a valid implementation to require the operator of the train to clear the
   heartbeat and provide an appropriate user interface to do so (e.g. audible or visual alert and
   acknowledgment button). This is prototypical behavior for real locomotives, also called “dead-man
   switch”.

                                           3 Background Information

    

3.1 Speed Control

   For OpenLCB, the speed and direction to set is encoded as a half-precision floating point number (aka
   'float16'), with positive numbers indicating forward direction, negative indicating reverse, and
   (signed) zero indicating full stop. The value specifies a speed in scale meters per second (scale-m/s).

   Note that even the zero value is signed.  This is needed because locomotives still have a direction,
   even when they are fully stopped.  It's used to control the configuration of lights and sounds that the
   locomotive exhibits when stopped.  “Negative zero” is well-defined in the IEEE float-16 standard, but
   not all libraries implement it well, and it's easy for code to convert the negative-zero value to the
   more common positive-zero by default.  Setting the sign after all computations are done is one way to
   handle this.

   Rationale: The use of a 16-bit floating point permits relatively precise speed commands, especially at
   lower speeds; such fine granularity ensures not just fine-grained control over the locomotive, but helps
   avoid aliasing issue that arise during the conversion to lower resolution system-specific speed commands
   (i.e. DCC's 14 or 28-step commands). Using 32-bit floats uses more bandwidth, more program and data
   memory and CPU cycles on small nodes, but is somewhat easier for large nodes.  The conversion between
   float-16 and float-32 is very simple, though, and any node with native 32-bit support can handle
   float-16 easily.  The converse is not true.

   The use of meters per second is somewhat arbitrary, and reflects standard velocity units used throughout
   the metric-speaking world. By standardizing on specific units, we avoid any future unit conversion
   issues. By standardizing on metric units, we simplify future attempts to simulate and control train
   physics.

   The use of scale meters per second has two distinct advantages. First, it permits us to transmit speed
   commands in a scale-independent way. Second, and because of this, it reduces the number of parameters
   that must be estimated when controlling a locomotive that has not yet been speed-calibrated (which, for
   new users using existing digital control systems, will be all of their models). For example, on a DCC
   system, if I issue a command to proceed at 30mph, the command station must convert the value in the
   speed command from 30mph to an integer in the range [0-26] (for 28-speed-step control). The command
   station need only estimate what a reasonable top speed for a locomotive might be: Let us say, 100mph.
   Thus, the command station could reasonably estimate that 30mph translates to speed step 8.

   The alternative possibilities considered were absolute speed using real units (as opposed to scale
   units), and relative speed units. The difficulty with relative speed units (i.e., percentage of full
   throttle), is that they are ambiguous, and preclude the possibility of performing physical simulations
   in the cab controller, at least without completely abandoning the particular interpretations assigned to
   sped values. The difficulty with using real (as opposed to scale) units is that it requires the
   estimation of an additional parameter for uncalibrated locomotives, specifically the train's scale. If I
   issue a command to a DCC locomotive to proceed at 0.1 (real)m/s, the command station must not only
   understand what a reasonable top speed for a train is, but how to scale the speed appropriately, as 0.1
   m/s might be quite fast for Z scale, but quite slow for G. As there is really no reasonable scale to use
   as a default, users must configure their digital command station to set the scale for either the entire
   layout, or on a per-model basis—an additional configuration step that is easily avoided by the mechanism
   for scale units described above.

3.2 Function Control

   "Functions" like "horn", "headlight", etc are key user features when operating modern decoders. But
   they're also configuration-like, in that they effect the operation of the device.

   How to handle them for a native OpenLCB piece of rolling stock, and for legacy ones via e.g. DCC?

   We could take the purist approach and say "configuration is configuration, it's all the same". But that
   ignores that many people are going to want "Bell" to appear (automatically) on their throttle, but not
   so many are going to want "Kp back-emf correction factor" to appear there.

   People just think about operating and configuring their locomotives as separate things. (Though e.g.
   "Master Volume" can cross the line)

   This doesn't mean that we can't use the same protocol for all of them. A mixture of memory configuration
   and CDI-like definition information should do just fine. It just means that we need to find a way to
   include clueing information for the throttles on e.g. what to present.

   Many trains offer independent control of various special effects (FX, sometimes called "functions") such
   as lighting or sound. The Set Function instruction permits a controller to control these effects
   directly. The first argument is the address of the FX to control as a 24-bit unsigned integer. This
   protocol does not define a semantics for FX addresses; that is, there is no particular address that is
   singled out as representing headlights or the air horn. Instead, the addresses are deliberately
   abstract, permitting the user to decide how to map addresses to FX for each train.

   Additionally, each FX can take a 16-bit value. Current technology only permits binary FX; thus 0x00
   should be interpreted as "off" for a binary FX, and any non-zero value as "on". Analog (non-binary) FX
   should treat the 16-bit value as an unsigned integer.

   Function values are stored in the 0xF9 memory space. "Function Definition Information", similar in
   intent to Configuration Definition Information (CDI) is stored in XML format in address space 0xFA to
   provide user-oriented context. That includes:

     * Memory layout of the function values, allowing for multiple data types from binary (one and off for
       lights) through integer values (for e.g. sound intensities) and strings (sign displays?).

     * Function naming, so that a throttle can display useful names to the user such as "Bell", "Coupler
       Clank" and "Master Volume". This includes internationalization of those labels.

   What else needs to be conveyed? "Make this prominent on the throttle"? "Have this there, just a little
   less prominent"? "Seriously, nobody cares about this option, bury it"?

   At present, there are no default values that e.g. associate "Bell" with a particular location or
   function. These are thought to be too brittle, and there are just too many possibilities to be useful
   (see the unscientific and incomplete Survey of existing function names).

  3.2.1 Outputs vs Functions

   Tools like DecoderPro and its decoder-definition files make a distinction between "functions", which are
   the control commands sent via e.g. DCC, and "outputs", which are the things that a decoder can do:
   Control an electrical output, make a sound, etc. This distinction is useful because one of the
   configuration options in (some) DCC decoders is a mapping between the functions and the outputs, useful
   in a world where throttles generally have only about a dozen buttons, but decoders have many output
   options.

   OpenLCB makes a clean separation between functions, which are the control operations, and all
   configuration & physical information, which lives in the memory configuration and CDI. If there's to be
   a mapping, it's defined through the CDI.

  3.2.2 Legacy DCC Function Control

   Although currently most DCC throttles only permit access to 12 or 29 functions, DCC technically permits
   as many as 32796 different binary FX (see RP-9.2.1: Function Group One Instruction, Function Group Two
   Instruction, and Feature Expansion Command Instruction especially the Binary State Control Subcommand).
   For this reason, it seems prudent to go ahead and use a 24-bit value.

   Likewise, although current DCC decoders only permit binary FX, some (for example SoundTraxx Tsunami
   sound decoders) actually permit a kind of analog control of FX by combining multiple DCC Functions.
   Thus, it seems likewise prudent to permit a wide range of values, and not simply a binary on and off.

   One problem that faces the decision to use a single command with a numerical FX addressing system is
   that any kind of standardized assignment of FX addresses to particular FX is impossible in practice.
   DCC, for example, makes no such prescription, although by convention function F0 controls
   direction-sensitive headlights. Beyond this lies only manufacturers' conventions. Thus, any kind of
   mapping is best handled on a per-train basis, by configuring the mapping between particular FX (e.g.
   headlights, air horn) to FX addresses for each train.

   One way to mitigate this problem is to not make fixed FX address assignments, but to map them directly
   onto the addressing scheme used by the various control systems, that is, to leave each address in the
   OpenLCB FX address space uninterpreted. In this way, the default behavior of each address will map
   directly onto the default behavior of the decoder in the train, giving some degree of predictability to
   the system, and permitting a digital command station the make reasonable guesses about the possible
   address-to-FX mappings. Nevertheless, users will often need to be exposed to this implementation detail,
   which is deeply unfortunate, but necessary given the ultimate flexibility of current train control
   systems.

   Thus, it is recommended that the FX address space be mapped directly to the particular control system's
   address space; thus DCC F0 becomes FX address 0x000000, F1 becomes 0x000001, etc. The DCC Binary State
   addresses should be mapped to 0x010000 to 0x017FFF (i.e., to the 15-bit range beginning with
   0b1.0000.0000.0000.0000). Other systems should be handled analogously.

   RP-9.2.1 defines the following:

     * Function Group One: 5 (F0-F4)

     * Function Group Two: 8 (F5-F12)

     * Binary State Control: 32767 (15bits) (note: different address space!)

     * Feature Expansion Command 11110: 8 (F13-F20)

     * Feature Expansion Command 11111: 8 (F21-F28)

   And in the future, perhaps even more. Possibly a lot more. There are just under 20 bits of address space
   available in the Feature Expansion Command Instruction for the potential manipulation of Binary State
   Controls.

3.3 Configuration

   Trains are OpenLCB nodes just like any other. As such, the Memory Configuration protocol can be used to
   configure them, the Configuration Description Information system can be used to make that process user
   friendly, etc. There's nothing traction-specific in these techniques, which are available any time that
   the train node is connected to the OpenLCB.

   The configuration information in a train can include the user documentation that's sometimes referred to
   as "roster information". This might include owner name, prototype railroad and road number, information
   about the particular model's construction, etc.  The Simple Train Node Information Protocol (STNIP) has
   been defined to implement this concept.

   Legacy DCC Configuration and Cvs

    

   [Moved here from the old Wiki Page]

   For CVs, one idea that we'd have a memory space that maps straight to the decoder CV space.

   That would allow decoder-specific CDI (if that was available) to customize what's presented. Like
   DecoderPro, the user wouldn't have to deal with CV 111, but rather with "Motor multisnarb angle offset"
   or whatever the user-fiendish manufacturer decides to provide as options.

   There are two remaining issues. First, is handling "indexed" CVs. (Ones where you write 12 to CV 51,
   then 8 to CV52, and then CV54 is the value you want to read/write). QSI is the only extensive user of
   these, but they're starting to appear in other places too.

   There are a couple ways to handle it. First, we could just map it as is: The configuring node would have
   to explicitly do those reads and writes. But that's a mess, well outside the OpenLCB model, and I've
   spent way to much time debugging weird failures with that.

   A better approach, I [Bob J] think, is to use the large address space. E.g. CV 59 is found at 0x00 00 00
   3B, while the one I mentioned above is found at 0x01 00 0C 08. (The 0x01 tells how to decode the address
   space, e.g. which CV the 2nd byte is written to, which the 3rd byte is written to. We'd have to extend
   CDI to carry that info, but it's within reason.

   The other issue is packed CVs, e.g. mapping parts of one or more CVs to a single "variable". This could
   be just a single bit in one CV, or something more complicated split across two (like long addresses).
   I'm not sure how to map those as a general case. For bits, I'd suggest another mapping trick, where some
   other part of the space is actually bit mapped:

   0xFF 00 53 3C

   is the middle bits (the 3C mask) of CV 53, and the 0xFF is just an arbitrary key for this. That doesn't
   work with noncontiguous splits across generic CVs, though, as that takes a lot to configure.

   (And don't get me started on CV1/CV29 sequencing; I think we just ignore that entirely at the CDI level
   & build it into the gateway to DCC)

   In the end, these legacy pains can't really be avoided. We have to craft the OpenLCB protocols to do a
   reasonable job with them, but I don't think we have to go nearly as far into the weird special cases as
   e.g. DecoderPro does.

   OpenLCB has a protocol for handling configuration of nodes. It should work fine for native OpenLCB
   rolling stock.

   Can/should it be adapted to handle the way existing DCC locomotives are configured through CVs?

3.4 How to find human-readable loco information

   e.g. SNII for getting the name of a real loco, DCC loco. Examples of how to provide a human-readable
   roster on the throttle.  Interactions with configuration.

   I believe we should strive to make our proposed system not be specific to a particular digital system
   (e.g. DCC) or otherwise biased. The procedure of "take the cab number from the loco, punch it in and
   drive" is actually quite US-specific.

   Balazs Racz wrote about how identification works in Europe:

   Each piece of rolling stock is labeled with a unique UIC number. UIC number is a 12 digit number which
   identifies the type of vehicle, the country in which it is registered, the owner, the type of vehicle
   and a unique number in its series. It might look like

   91 85 0 474 014 2

   This number is written in a size on the prototype that is legible to a person standing next to it. It is
   very much not obvious to read it off of a model. this number is not really suitable to punch into a
   throttle in order to get going...

   [Note about assumptions: Freight cars also have such an ID. However, JMRI itself limits the length of
   the car ID t something like 8 or 10 characters, so it is not possible to accurately represent a European
   freight car in JMRI.]

   If you take the shortcut of removing the type and country code, then you end up with 474014, which is a
   common way to refer to a locomotive say within Switzerland. However, this is too long for a DCC address!
   So I don't have the choice of putting in the cab number as address. (Of course now your numbers are not
   unique, for example see http://cfr.stfp.net/Pic/47/915304740144DQOM:1.jpg and
   http://www.bahnbilder.de/1024/sbb-fahrzeugausstellung-bei-sbb-459408.jpg)

   Another example: MFX is the current track protocol of Marklin. MFX is bidirectional, and locomotives
   sign in with the command station as soon as they get put on the track. MFX uses 11, 14 or 28 bit
   addresses. The locomotive address is assigned by the command station upon the login of the locomotive.
   It is not persistent. The user never sees the locomotive address and in fact it may even be changed by
   the command station if it so desires.

   So punching in the loco address into the throttle is also not an option.

   Example 3: Older Marklin protocol (Marklin-Motorola protocol or MM) supported only 79 different
   addresses on the track. Then the address on the track had again nothing to do with the actual engine
   number, and you don't need to have an extraordinarily large collection to run into duplicate addresses.
   However, owners of such collections do typically remember the two-digit address of each locomotive they
   have, because older command stations only had digit buttons for selecting a locomotive.

   I would find it a shame if the recommended design of OpenLCB would only support US-based roads.

   State of the art command stations have color touchscreens where they display you a list of locomotives
   that you can select from with a fingerpress and get running. You either populate this roster by hand, or
   it gets populated automatically for locomotives that log in via track feedback systems (like MFX or
   RailcomPlus). Typically pictures are also assigned to each locomotive.

   Note that SNII/ACDI defines a manufacturer as < 41 bytes, model name < 41 bytes, hardware & software
   versions < 21, node name < 63 bytes, node description < 64 bytes (including terminating null), much more
   of than Balazs' example.

3.5 Consisting and Listeners

   Consisting is a process familiar to model railroaders, who use it for many purposes:

     * Run multiple diesel engines together as a model MU

     * Run helper locomotives together due to a shortage of (real) engineers

     * Connect multiple pieces of rolling stock (passenger cars, cabooses) together to make it easier to
       control sound and lighting effects

     * Connect sound decoders with motion-control decoders so they work well together

   OpenLCB handles consisting by introducing the “Listener” concept to all train nodes. A listener is
   attached to a given train node in order to receive a copy of all state changing requests that arrive at
   the given train node. This serves multiple purposes:

     * Consist follower engines can be attached directly to the consist lead train node and receive all
       speed set commands, which will cause the consist to move together.

     * Throttles that lose the control of a locomotive (through stealing or hand-over) can register
       themselves as listener on the locomotive, and update the UI as the other engineer is driving the
       train.

     * It becomes possible to add a display to the train node that displays a train's status and keeps it
       up to date without polling for updates and unnecessarily consuming bus bandwidth.

   Consisting can be applied by two methods:

    1. If the lead engine supports listeners, then the consist followers can be added directly to the lead
       as a listener. Note that the forwarded message is defined in a way that the consist follower sees it
       as if it came from a regular throttle, therefore the consist follower engine is allowed to not be
       aware of the consisting.

    2. If no engine in the consist can be chosen as lead engine, then a virtual node can be instantiated
       that supports listeners and has the ability to attach all consist members. Such virtual nodes may be
       provided by throttles or command stations.

   The listener configuration allows selecting some common use-cases for the consist:

     * Forward speed only.

     * Forward speed but invert direction (when the following locomotive is backwards-facing in the
       consist).

     * Forward function zero (usually light). Turning this on for the lead and the tail engine in the
       consist, but off for all middle members of the consist will cause the consist to behave
       prototypically with headlights.

     * Forward all functions. Useful for the throttle listener use-case or in case the two locomotives are
       equipped with identical decoders and features.

     * More advanced configuration (e.g. function remapping, arbitrary function filter) may be applied by
       using the regular configuration user interface of the consist lead node (e.g. CDI). Such advanced
       configuration may be however cumbersome for the user to access, since dumb throttles may not have
       the ability to render arbitrary CDIs, while specialized user interface could be developed according
       to the above listed common options. Also creating and deleting consists may be considered as an
       everyday operation to users, therefore advanced consist settings may be accidentally destroyed. An
       appropriate save/restore feature may be necessary.

   The consist's listener relation may be established in a symmetric manner, where the lead engine is also
   attached as a listener to each individual follower engine. Symmetric listener relations are allowed and
   cause no problem for the network, because a train node is required to never echo back a packet to where
   it came from.

   The benefit of a symmetric listener relation is that now the consist can be driven by calling up any
   train number in it, and the control packets will be propagated to all members of the consist. This may
   be helpful if the user wants to drive a consist by the tail engine (for example after a runaround move)
   and use e.g. the horn feature on the tail engine. Of course this feature will only work if the tail
   locomotive supports listeners, otherwise it is impossible to establish a symmetric listener relation.

   It is important that the symmetric listener relations create a spanning tree in the consist nodes. If
   there is any directed circle (longer than 2 nodes), any message injected will be forwarded between those
   nodes forever.

   and similar “one acts for many” situations by having a node act as the front-man for the consisted
   group. This node may be a real physical object, but it's more likely to be a software construct
   somewhere within the hardware that's used to connect the main OpenLCB network to the actual trains.

   Once the consisting relationship has been initialized, it will handle the individual parts of the
   Traction Protocol series:

     * Speed Control - this is perhaps the simplest, just passing the speed values through to the
       individual members of the consist. Because OpenLCB speeds are in scale meters/second, there's by
       definition no need to rescale them when forwarding them to disparate equipment

     * Function Control - Although the setup process may be able to map or reassign functions in the
       consist-member nodes, in the end this protocol is just a pass-through of the function instructions
       and memory access protocol operations.

     * Train Configuration - except for very limited configuration of the consist itself, the consist does
       not take part in any configuration operations. Those are done by talking directly to the nodes that
       control the individual pieces of the consist. (CDI for a specialized consist node is going to
       require careful definition)

     * Train Acquisition Protocol - the consist, if controlled by a special node, is a separately locatable
       thing, as throttles will want to be able to find it. As such, it will take part in producing the
       well-known events, providing human readable (and writable) information via SNII/ACDI, etc, and being
       the target of search operations. Consists driven by their lead engine can be operated by calling up
       the lead engine in a throttle. Consists with symmetric listener relationships can be driven by
       calling up any single node in the consist. Defining the assigned controllers may be tricky in such a
       situation.

   Because there's no protocol difference between full-OpenLCB-node Trains and legacy equipment that uses
   OpenLCB proxy nodes, consisting works the same for all of those. It can even mix-and-match full nodes
   with various types of legacy trains, if that's electrically possible. Proxies can handle multiple node
   IDs (and/or DCC addresses), which allows implementation of consisting.  Speed/direction just passes
   through; speed matching is automatic due to the use of scale meters/second for units.
