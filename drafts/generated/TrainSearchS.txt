                                                   Oct 22, 2019                        Preliminary          

                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   Minimal introductory material, only the stuff that's absolutely needed to understand the Standard.This
   standard defines a method for Throttle Nodes to find Train Nodes on the network, and for legacy
   use-cases, instruct an OpenLCB Command Station to create a virtual Train Node given a legacy address and
   track protocol. This standard is not specific to any wire protocol.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   The OpenLCB Traction Protocol describes how a Node acting as throttle can and should control a Node
   acting as a train. An important component of an ecosystem is how the throttle can find the remote train
   node that corresponds to the user’s desired locomotive to control. This standard defines one possible
   method on how to find train nodes from a throttle. As a basic transport this method uses the Event
   Transport protocol.

   In addition to finding already existing Train Nodes, this standard describes an interaction that can be
   followed by a Command Station to instantiate virtual Nodes in order to act as a gateway between the
   OpenLCB traction protocol and a legacy track protocol such as DCC. As part of this interaction, certain
   options are specifically enumerated in this standard that are specific to current commonly used legacy
   track protocols (such as DCC), while leaving expansion space for including additional such protocols in
   future revisions.

   In that scheme, both the Throttle is a fully standards-complian OpenLCB Node on the network, and the
   Train is representedIn a separate standard, there is an OpenLCB protocol describing how a Throttle can
   control a Train with addressed OpenLCB messages of the appropriate MTI and given format.Any limitations
   to the area of use of the Standard.Note that this standard does not exclude other methods and standards,
   including some not yet developed, for the same or similar purposes. See the Train Search Protocol
   Technical Note for some alternatives that were considered or can be employed based on more general
   enumeration protocols.

   TODO: move this discussion to the TN as “Alternatives Considered”:

     * A more generic protocol could be developed for searching for Nodes on the network; this may be
       peer-to-peer or based on a centralized database built and maintained by a single Node that stores
       details about all Nodes available on the network (including all Train Nodes).

     * All Nodes can be enumerated by the unaddressed Verify Node ID Global message. There is no throttling
       mechanism provisioned to maintain the list of replies with a limited amount of memory. The Node list
       can then be further processed using Protocol Support Inquiry (PIP) messages to restrict to Train
       Nodes and Simple Node Information Request (SNIP) messages for querying identifying properties such
       as train name.

     * All Train Nodes can be identified using the Well-Known Event ID IsTrain. There is no throttling
       mechanism provisioned to maintain the list of replies with a limited amount of memory.

     * A legacy track protocol Command Station could expose a command interface either via dedicated
       OpenLCB messages or via a Datagram-based protocol to maintain it’s list of virtual Train Nodes. This
       protocol could also be out-of-band, for example through a user interface (physical or HTTP-based),
       or could be coupled to a persistent database using the Memory Configuration Protocol and the
       Configuration Descriptor (CDI) XML to expose the user interface via a Configuration Tool.

5.1 Identifier Range allocation and License terms

   Vivamus tristique porta ornare. Vivamus feugiat dolor id lectus aliquet luctus. For the purpose of the
   Train Search Protocol the following block of consecutive Event Identifiers is allocated:

   09.00.99.FF.00.00.00.00 – 09.00.99.FF.FF.FF.FF.FF

   All Event Identifiers in this range are reserved for exclusive use according to the interactions defined
   by this standard and shall not be used for any other purpose.

   The legal entity to whom this Event Identifier range is allocated by the Event Identifiers Standard,
   Train Control Systems, Inc, hereby grants an irrevocable, non-transferable license to anyone for using
   the quoted Event Identifiers on the condition, and only so long as, that their use is compliant to this
   Standard or any later version of it, published by Train Control Systems, Inc.

                                          6 Interactions (Normative)

   The following hardware and software nodes are taking part in the interactions presented here:

     * The Train Node is an OpenLCB Node that implements the Traction Protocol, controlling a single
       (physical) train with one or more coupled engines. The hardware implementing the Train Node may be
       physically built into a model, or it may be built into a centralized gateway hardware that converts
       to a non-OpenLCB protocol in order to remotely control an engine, for example via Bluetooth or a
       legacy track protocol such as DCC or Märklin-Motorola. In this case a single piece of hardware may
       be responsible for representing multiple OpenLCB Nodes on the network.

     * The Throttle Node is an OpenLCB Node that intends to send Traction Protocol commands to a desired
       Train Node. The Throttle Node may be a physical hardware device with a user interface to be used by
       an operator, a computer software with a user interface for operators to control trains, or a fully
       automated software.

     * The Command Station is a gateway for proxying to some non-OpenLCB protocol, implementing Train
       Node(s), and having an OpenLCB network connection. There may or may not be a separate OpenLCB Node
       that represents the Command Station itself on the OpenLCB network.

6.1 Search for existing train nodes

   The goal of this use-case is for a Throttle Node to enumerate Train Nodes that exist on the network and
   match certain criteria. The Throttle Node shall represent the given criteria as an Event Identifier E
   according to Section 5.2, and shall set the flag byte ‘rr’ Bit 7 (Allocate) to zero (0).

     * The Throttle Node shall send an “Identify Producer” message with setting the Event Identifier to E
       to the network.

     * A Train Node, upon receipt of an Identify Producer message with an Event Identifier E falling into
       the Event Identifier Range of Section 5.1, shall

          * compare the Train Node’s identifying properties to the search criteria represented by the Event
            Identier E according to Section 6.3;

          * in case of a match, the Train Node shall emit a “Producer Identified” message with the Event
            Identifier E to the network, setting the Producer validity bits according to Section 6.3;

          * in absence of a match, the Train Node shall not emit a “Producer Identified” message with the
            Event Identifier E.

6.2 Allocate a new Train Node

   The goal of this use-case is for a Throttle Node to instruct a Command Station to create a new Train
   Node in the case that no existing Train Node(s) match the search criteria requested by the Throttle
   Node. This interaction can also be used to change the Protocol Version of an existing Train Node.

   The Throttle Node shall represent the requested address as an Event Identifier E according to Section
   5.2, with setting the flag byte ‘rr’ Bit 7 (Allocate) to one (0x80). The Throttle Node may, but is not
   required to, specify the desired track protocol in the flag byte. It is recommended that the Throttle
   Node also sets the Bit 6 (Exact) to one (0x40) in the flag byte.

     * The Throttle Node shall send an “Identify Producer” message with setting the Event Identifier to E
       to the network.

     * A Command Station upon receipt of an Identify Producer message with an Event Identifier E falling
       into the Event Identifier Range of Section 5.1 with the flag byte ‘rr’ Bit 7 (Allocate) set to one,
       shall

          * validate that it has the ability to create a Train Node matching its identifying properties to
            the search criteria represented by the Event Identifier E according to Section 6.3; for
            properties marked as ‘Any / Default’ by the Event Identifier E the Command Station may pick any
            implementation-specific default value;

          * wait at least 200 msec for existing Train Nodes to reply with a “Producer Identified” message;

          * in the absence of such reply, the Command Station shall

               * allocate a new Train Node according to the properties defined by the Event Identifier E,
                 or

               * adjust the Protocol Version of an existing Train Node conflicting with the requested
                 address to match the value defined by the Event Identifier E,

   then instruct the Train Node to emit a “Producer Identified Valid” message with the Event Identifier E.

6.3 Event Identifier matching algorithm

   This section defines when an Event Identifier E in the range defined by Section 5.1 matches a Train Node
   with the identifying properties of <Name, Address, Protocol, Protocol Version>.

   The Train Node matches the Event Identifier E iff the search query represented by the qq qq qq nibbles
   of E matches and the requirement by the rr flag byte matches the Protocol and Protocol Version and the
   Flag byte or the query nibbles specify no reserved values marked as “check upon receipt”.

   The flag byte rr matches Protocol iff the Track Protocol field of rr is set to “Default/Any” or Protocol
   matches the value of the Track Protocol field.

   The flag byte rr matches Protocol Version iff the Track Protocol field of rr is set to the specific
   value or range matching Protocol and the version bits of rr are set to “Default/Any” or to a value that
   matches Protocol Version.

   The search query represented by the qq qq qq nibbles of E matches iff

     * qq qq qq matches the Address of the Train Node, or

     * the Address only bit is not set in the Flag byte rr and qq qq qq matches the Name.

   Vivamus tristique porta ornare. Vivamus feugiat dolor id lectus aliquet luctus. The qq qq qq nibbles of
   E matches the Address iff qq qq qq contains exactly one contiguous sequence of digit nibbles ‘0’-’9’,
   and

     * Protocol is non-DCC, or

     * the Flag byte rr specifies “Default/Any” protocol, or

     * Bit 2 (DCC - Force long address bit) is clear in the Flag byte rr, or

     * Address is >= 128, or

     * Address is a DCC 14-bit (long) address

   and

     * the Exact bit of the Flag byte rr is set and the decimal value represented by these nibbles is the
       value of the Address, or

     * the Exact bit if the Flag byte rr is clear and the decimal nibbles form a prefix of the decimal
       representation of  Address.

   A contiguous sequence of digit nibbles nn...n match the Name iff there is a substring of decimal digits
   vv...v in Name not immediately preceded by any further digits where nn...n = vv...v and

     * Flag byte rr has Bit 6 (Exact) not set, or

     * vv...v in Name is not immediately followed by any further digits.

8.1 Search Result Differentiation

   A Train Node replying with Producer Identified message may, but is not required to pick the response
   message from the set of Producer Identified Valid, Producer Identified Invalid and Producer Identified
   Unknown to differentiate on how well the search query matches the Train Node’s properties, using the
   ratings of ‘Valid’ > ‘Invalid’ > ‘Unknown’ in quality. A Node may use any implementation-specific
   algorithm, which may also take into account properties not represented in this standard for making the
   determination.

   If a Train Node does not make differentiation, it shall use Producer Identified Unknown as response
   message for Search responses.
