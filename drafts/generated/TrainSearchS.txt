                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This standard defines a method for Throttle Nodes to find Train Nodes on the network, and for legacy
   use-cases, instruct an OpenLCB Command Station to create a virtual Train Node given a legacy address and
   track protocol. This standard is not specific to any wire protocol.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   The OpenLCB Traction Protocol describes how a Node acting as throttle can and should control a Node
   acting as a train. An important component of an ecosystem is how the throttle can find the remote train
   node that corresponds to the user’s desired locomotive to control. This standard defines one possible
   method on how to find train nodes from a throttle. As a basic transport this method uses the Event
   Transport protocol.

   In addition to finding already existing Train Nodes, this standard describes an interaction that can be
   followed by a Command Station to instantiate virtual Nodes in order to act as a gateway between the
   OpenLCB traction protocol and a legacy track protocol such as DCC. As part of this interaction, certain
   options are specifically enumerated in this standard that are specific to current commonly used legacy
   track protocols (such as DCC), while leaving expansion space for including additional such protocols in
   future revisions.

   Note that this standard does not exclude other methods and standards, including some not yet developed,
   for the same or similar purposes. See the Train Search Protocol Technical Note for some alternatives
   that were considered or can be employed based on more general enumeration protocols.

                                           5 Allocation (Normative)

5.1 Identifier Range allocation and License terms

   For the purpose of the Train Search Protocol the following block of consecutive Event Identifiers is
   allocated:

   09.00.99.FF.00.00.00.00 – 09.00.99.FF.FF.FF.FF.FF

   All Event Identifiers in this range are reserved for exclusive use according to the interactions defined
   by this standard and shall not be used for any other purpose.

   The legal entity to whom this Event Identifier range is allocated by the Event Identifiers Standard,
   Train Control Systems, Inc, hereby grants an irrevocable, non-transferable license to anyone for using
   the quoted Event Identifiers on the condition, and only so long as, that their use is compliant to this
   Standard or any later version of it, published by Train Control Systems, Inc., or the OpenLCB Group.

5.2 Identifier Format

   The Event Identifiers in the given range are defined as follows:

   Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4 Byte 5 Byte 6 Byte 7 Byte 8 
   09     00     99     FF     qq     qq     qq     rr     
                               Search query                
   Fixed prefix                                     Flags
                               (6 nibbles)

    

   The search query ‘qq qq qq’ shall be a sequence of 6 nibbles in MSB-first order stored in Bytes 5, 6 and
   7 of the Event Identifier. Each individual nibble is one position of the search string:

   Search Query Nibble value Description                                                                    
   0 - 9                     The given position of the search term is the given number                      
   0xA - 0xE                 Reserved. Do not send, check upon receipt.                                     
                             Empty / unused character position. Short queries shall be padded with this     
   0xF                       nibble value to 6 characters long. Multiple search terms may be concatenated   
                             to a search query with this nibble as a separator between them which means the 
                             individual terms shall be evaluated with AND relation between them.            

    

   The flag byte ‘rr’ is defined as follows:

                                              0: All matches (including partial match) 
                                              0x20: Match only in address

                                          6 Interactions (Normative)

   The following hardware and software nodes are taking part in the interactions presented here:

     * The Train Node is an OpenLCB Node that implements the Traction Protocol, controlling a single
       (physical) train with one or more coupled engines. The hardware implementing the Train Node may be
       physically built into a model, or it may be built into a centralized gateway hardware that converts
       to a non-OpenLCB protocol in order to remotely control an engine, for example via Bluetooth or a
       legacy track protocol such as DCC or Märklin-Motorola. In this case a single piece of hardware may
       be responsible for representing multiple OpenLCB Nodes on the network.

     * The Throttle Node is an OpenLCB Node that intends to send Traction Protocol commands to a desired
       Train Node. The Throttle Node may be a physical hardware device with a user interface to be used by
       an operator, a computer software with a user interface for operators to control trains, or a fully
       automated software.

     * The Command Station is a gateway for proxying to some non-OpenLCB protocol, implementing Train
       Node(s), and having an OpenLCB network connection. There may or may not be a separate OpenLCB Node
       that represents the Command Station itself on the OpenLCB network.

   A Train Node has a set of properties, the following of which are relevant for the interactions defined
   in this Standard:

     * Name is a user-assigned textual description for the train.

     * Protocol defines the native command set that is used to address this train. The options are listed
       in the Track Protocol table.

     * Address is a user-assigned numerical value that uniquely identifies a train within a Protocol. There
       cannot be two trains with the same Protocol and same Address on the track at the same time. Not all
       Protocols have a user-assigned Address. The Address for the DCC Protocol also carries a
       disambiguator on whether it is a short (7-bit) or long (14-bit) DCC address.

     * Protocol Version selects the exact command set to use for a Track Protocol. Users sometimes have to
       select a specific Protocol Version to correctly operate a train or to access all possible features
       of it.

6.1 Search for existing train nodes

   The goal of this use-case is for a Throttle Node to enumerate Train Nodes that exist on the network and
   match certain criteria. The Throttle Node shall represent the given criteria as an Event Identifier E
   according to Section 5.2, and shall set the flag byte ‘rr’ Bit 7 (Allocate) to zero (0).

     * The Throttle Node shall send an “Identify Producer” message with setting the Event Identifier to E
       to the network.

     * A Train Node, upon receipt of an Identify Producer message with an Event Identifier E falling into
       the Event Identifier Range of Section 5.1, shall

          * compare the Train Node’s identifying properties to the search criteria represented by the Event
            Identifier E according to Section 6.3;

          * in case of a match, the Train Node shall emit a “Producer Identified” message with the Event
            Identifier E to the network, setting the Producer validity bits according to Section 6.4;

          * in absence of a match, the Train Node shall not emit a “Producer Identified” message with the
            Event Identifier E.

6.2 Allocate a new Train Node

   The goal of this use-case is for a Throttle Node to instruct a Command Station to create a new Train
   Node in the case that no existing Train Node(s) match the search criteria requested by the Throttle
   Node. This interaction can also be used to change the Protocol Version of an existing Train Node.

   The Throttle Node shall represent the requested address as an Event Identifier E according to Section
   5.2, with setting the flag byte ‘rr’ Bit 7 (Allocate) to one (0x80). The Throttle Node may, but is not
   required to, specify the desired track protocol in the flag byte. It is recommended that the Throttle
   Node also sets Bit 6 (Exact) to one (0x40) in the flag byte.

     * The Throttle Node shall send an “Identify Producer” message with setting the Event Identifier to E
       to the network.

     * A Command Station upon receipt of an Identify Producer message with an Event Identifier E falling
       into the Event Identifier Range of Section 5.1 with the flag byte ‘rr’ Bit 7 (Allocate) set to one,
       shall

          * validate that it has the ability to create a Train Node matching its identifying properties to
            the search criteria represented by the Event Identifier E according to Section 6.3; for
            properties marked as ‘Any / Default’ by the Event Identifier E the Command Station may pick any
            implementation-specific default value;

          * wait at least 200 msec for existing Train Nodes to reply with a “Producer Identified” message;

          * in the absence of such reply, the Command Station shall

               * allocate a new Train Node according to the properties defined by the Event Identifier E,
                 or

               * adjust the Protocol Version of an existing Train Node conflicting with the requested
                 address to match the value defined by the Event Identifier E,

   then instruct the Train Node to emit a “Producer Identified Valid” message with the Event Identifier E.

6.3 Event Identifier matching algorithm

   This section defines when an Event Identifier E in the range defined by Section 5.1 matches a Train Node
   with the identifying properties of <Name, Address, Protocol, Protocol Version>.

   The Train Node matches the Event Identifier E if and only if

     * the search query represented by the qq qq qq nibbles of E matches, AND

     * the requirement by the rr flag byte matches the Protocol and Protocol Version, AND

     * the Flag byte or the query nibbles specify no reserved values marked as “check upon receipt”.

   The flag byte rr matches Protocol if and only if the Track Protocol field of rr is set to “Default/Any”
   OR Protocol matches the value of the Track Protocol field.

   The flag byte rr matches Protocol Version if and only if the Track Protocol field of rr is set to the
   specific value or range matching Protocol and the version bits of rr are set to “Default/Any” or to a
   value that matches Protocol Version.

   We say that the Flag byte rr requests a DCC long address if and only if rr specifies the DCC protocol
    AND Bit 2 (DCC - Force long address bit) is set.

   The search query represented by the qq qq qq nibbles of E matches if and only if

     * qq qq qq matches the Address of the Train Node, OR

     * Bit 5 (Address only) is clear in the Flag byte rr  AND  qq qq qq matches the Name.

   The qq qq qq nibbles of E matches the Address if and only if qq qq qq contains exactly one contiguous
   sequence of digit nibbles ‘0’-’9’, AND

     * Protocol is not DCC, OR

     * the decimal value represented by these nibbles is >= 128, OR

     * the Flag byte rr requests a DCC long address AND Address is a DCC 14-bit (long) address, OR

     * the Flag byte rr does not request a DCC long address AND Address is a DCC 7-bit (short) address, OR

     * the Flag byte rr does not request a DCC long address AND Bit 7 (Allocate) is clear in the Flag byte
       rr

   AND

     * the Exact bit of the Flag byte rr is set AND the decimal value represented by these nibbles is the
       value of the Address, OR

     * the Exact bit if the Flag byte rr is clear AND the decimal nibbles form a prefix of the decimal
       representation of Address.

    

   The qq qq qq nibbles of E matches the Name if and only if qq qq qq contains one or more contiguous
   sequence of digit nibbles 0x00x-0x9 separated with one or more nibble 0xF and each of those match the
   Name.

   A maximal1 contiguous sequence of digit nibbles nn...n in E match the Name if and only if there is a
   pair of positions [p,q] in Name such that there is no digit character immediately preceding position p
   in Name, AND  nn...n equals the concatenation of all digit characters found in Name from position p  to
   q2, AND

     * Flag byte rr has Bit 6 (Exact) not set, OR

     * there is no digit character immediately following position q in Name.

6.4 Search Result Differentiation

   A Train Node replying with Producer Identified message may, but is not required to to differentiate on
   how accurately the search query matches the Train Node’s properties by picking the response message from
   the set of Producer Identified Valid, Producer Identified Invalid and Producer Identified Unknown
   messages. The responses represent the quality of match with ‘Valid’ > ‘Invalid’ > ‘Unknown’. A Node may
   use any implementation-specific algorithm, which may also take into account properties not represented
   in this standard for making the determination.

   If a Train Node does not make a differentiation, it shall use Producer Identified Unknown as response
   message for Search responses.
