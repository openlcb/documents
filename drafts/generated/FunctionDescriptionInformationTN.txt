                                                 ConfigurationFunction Description Information

                                                    Nov 9, 2014                        Preliminary          

                                                1 Introduction

   "ConfigurationFunction description information" in this context refers to fixed information available
   from an OpenLCB Train device, via OpenLCB, so that other devices can properly and correctly configure
   it. The information is fixed, so that it can be pre-compressed, stored in the device, and just supplied
   when needed with minimal work on the part of the device and the device's developers. This means that
   e.g. the actual current configuration contents are not available as part of the CDIFDI, as that is
   variable information. Similarly, the CDIFDI cannot contain e.g. a serial number as that would require
   different CDIFDI contents in each node of a single type.

   Other information may be available via e.g. manuals or the Internet, and there may be pointers to that
   information in the CDIFDI, but the format of that information is not under specification here.

   A key use for CDIFDI is to enable a Configuration Tool (CT) to know how to configure the node. The
   configuration tool will use the CDIFDI information to render some form of suitable Graphical User
   Interface to allow the user to easily and intuitively configure all aspects of the node's capabilities.
   An important design choice was to embed the CDIFDI into each node so that the system has all it needs to
   configure the node without having to source the information externally to the OpenLCB network from the
   manufacturer or some other on-line repository via the Internet or a CD/DVD etc. While the CT is likely
   to be a program running on a PC, it could be a hand-held devicethrottle like mobile phone or PDA or even
   a custom-built device.

                                        2 Annotations to the Standard

2.1 Introduction

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

2.2 Intended Use

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

2.3 Reference and Context

   See Memory Configuration Protocol. That's one use for the CDIFDI, and one way to retrieve it, but CDIFDI
   is independent of that.

   CiA 306 “Electronic data sheet specification” describes the CANopen version of a similar capability.

                                     3 Stuff to be merged into the above

3.1 Environment of Proposal

  3.1.1 Requirements

     * Nodes must carry enough context that a stand-alone configuration tool can provide a useful human
       interface without getting any data from an external source, e.g. needing an Internet download to
       handle a new node type.

     * It must be possible to configure a node entirely over the OpenLCB, without physical interactions,
       e.g. pushing buttons.

  3.1.2 Preferences

     * Small nodes shouldn't need a lot of processing power, e.g. to compress or decompress data in real
       time. Memory usage should also be limited, but is a second priority.

     * Configuration operations should be state-less and idempotent to simplify software at both ends.

     * Multiple independent configuration operations can proceed at the same time. Specifically, multiple
       devices should be able to retrieve correct configuration description information at the same time.

  Design Points

   Basic configuration is done with the configuration protocol defined elsewhere.

   The “Variables” described here are not exactly the same thing as “Configuration Variables” (CVs) or
   “Node Variables” (NVs) that are discussed elsewhere. Those are aimed at storage, and so are grouped by
   address. The “Variables” here are grouped by function. “Long address” might be several CVs, but would be
   one variable to this proposal. Similarly, CV29 has lots of variables within it, each stored as bits.
   Perhaps it would be better to use a different name here, such as “Setting” or “Option”?

3.2 Proposal

  3.2.1 Definition

   must be able to represent them, but may not require any specific organization.CDI

   4B) A Node can contain zero or more "Producers". Each Producer is independently configured. There is no
   ordering between separate Producers, but they can be numbered for ease of reference.

   4C) A Node can contain zero or more "Consumers". Each Consumer is independently configured. There is no
   ordering between separate Consumers, or between individual Consumers and Producers, but they can be
   numbered for ease of reference.

   4D) Each Producer or Consumer can be configured with zero or one Events.

   4E) Each Event has an Identifier which uniquely defines it. An event may optionally carry additional
   data.

   4F) To ensure future growth, there is no required "device", "channel" or other grouping within a node.
   Those may be present in some node types, and for their needed configuration information. The protocol
   for that will be defined elsewhere/elsewhen.CDI can and should reflect:

   4A) The basic OpenLCB unit is a "Node". Nodes provide CDI

   3) Secondary constraints are testability of the provided information, scalability of the format, and the
   convenience and availability of a suitable toolchain.

   4) There is a physical/logical structure to the configuration which the

   -consuming device should also be considered. In particular, code complexity is an issue which must be
   addressed.

   CDI.

   2A) Size and complexity in the providing device is the more important constraint. There are more of
   those devices, they are cost sensitive, and they may not be upgradable once delivered.

   2B) Size and complexity in the CDI, and complexity and size in the device consuming the CDI

   2) The primary design constraints are complexity and size in the OpenLCB device providing Function
   values are stored in the 0xF9 memory space. "Function Definition Information", similar in intent to
   Configuration Definition Information (CDI) is stored in XML format in address space 0xFA to provide
   user-oriented context. That includes:

   Memory layout of the function values, allowing for multiple data types from binary (one and off for
   lights) through integer values (for e.g. sound intensities) and strings (sign displays?).

   Function naming, so that a throttle can display useful names to the user such as "Bell", "Coupler Clank"
   and "Master Volume". This includes internationalization of those labels.

   What else needs to be conveyed? "Make this prominent on the throttle"? "Have this there, just a little
   less prominent"? "Seriously, nobody cares about this option, bury it"?

   At present, there are no default values that e.g. associate "Bell" with a particular location or
   function. These are thought to be too brittle, and there are just too many possibilities to be useful
   (see the unscientific and incomplete Survey of existing function names).

   Sample function definition XML:

   <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>

   <?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='xslt/fdi.xsl'?>

   <fdi xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
   xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation='http://openlcb.org/trunk/prototypes/xml/schema/fdi.xsd'>

   <segment origin='0' space='250'>

   <group>

   <name>Lighting Functions</name>

   <description>Headlights and Markerlights and Runninglights, oh my.</description>

   <function offset="5" size ="1" kind="binary">

   <name>Headlights</name>

   <number>0</number>

   </function>

   <function size ="1" >

   <name>Ditch Lights</name>

   <number>4</number>

   </function>

   </group>

   <group>

   <name>Sound Functions</name>

   <description>Toot toot!.</description>

   <function size ="2" kind="analog">

   <name>Horn</name>

   <number>8</number>

   </function>

   </group>

   </segment>

   </fdi>

   The structure is similar to CDI, with named sections that give the general location of the storage.
   "number" is a hint that can be used to locate the function on a numbered GUI element (e.g. button);
   "name" is the same if the GUI element can have a readable label.

   "kind" is an enumerated type of (initially) "binary" and "analog". These are done as specific elements
   in CDI, and perhaps that's a better approach.

   A sample implementation of the DCC F0-F28 functions, as described on the Function Control page:

   <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>

   <?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='xslt/fdi.xsl'?>

   <fdi xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
   xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation='http://openlcb.org/trunk/prototypes/xml/schema/fdi.xsd'>

   <segment origin='0' space='250'>

   <group>

   <name>F0-F28</name>

   <description>Standard DCC functions</description>

   <function size="1" kind="binary">

   <name>Headlight</name>

   <number>0</number>

   </function>

   <function size="1">

   <number>1</number>

   </function>

   ...

   <function size="1">

   <number>28</number>

   </function>

   </group>

   </segment>

   </fdi>

  3.2.2 Storage

   THIS IS COPIED FROM THE CDI CURRENTLY, THIS NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO BE FDI SPECIFIC..........

   The configuration definition is stored in a hierarchical manner.

   I) In what follows:

   A "String" must be present; an "Optional String" does not have to be. Strings are in UTF-8.

   An "Integer" may be signed; if no sign, it's taken as positive.

   A "Map" provides a set of named descriptive values. It contains:

   Name: Optional String, if present required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Description: Optional String

   1 or more "Key", "Value" pairs. Each element of the pair can be of any supported type, depending only on
   how it is to be used.

   Map elements provide a mapping between the pairs they contain. For example, a map can relate numeric
   values for a variable to description strings. A map can also be used to provide free-form documentation
   when neither the key nor the value are specified in advance. It may be useful in the future to specify
   how maps can be defined at the group level to reduce duplication. Having the possibility of a “Name” is
   meant to ease that future effort.

   II) At the top, root level is the information for a "node". This includes:

   Manufacturer: String

   Descriptive Map: May contain “Model”, “Version”, “URL” and “Description” keys, along with any others
   desired.

   Model: If present, the human-readable model name the manufacturer gives to this node.

   Version: If present, the human-readable version string for the current board.

   Description: Optional String

   URL: If present, a URL for more information. No specific content is expected at the URL; If desired,
   that can be dealt with in a different specification.

   Any other information desired can be added via additional keys.

   III) Within the node is zero or more "groups". Each group contains:

   Name: String, required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Descriptive Map: Map of documentation information; the “Description” key is the basic item.

   Replication count: Integer >= 1 (number of times this group is replicated within the parent item)

   A group with a replication count > 1 (called a replicated group) can be used to represent a type of
   replicated device. For example, a node with 4 identical input devices and 6 identical output devices can
   be compactly described by two groups, with replication counts of 4 and 6 respectively.

   Individual groups within replicated groups are numbered from 1 to the replication count. If more than
   one replicated group is present, the numbering for each starts again with 1.

   Groups may contain one or more inner groups, with the same representation. This may continue to any
   desired level.

   IV) Groups may contain "variable", "producer" and/or "consumer" descriptions.

   IV-a) A "variable" description contains:

   Name: String, required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Type: Exactly one of "boolean", "digit" (an unsigned binary-coded-decimal value), "signed" (a binary
   value with a sign), "unsigned" (a binary value without a sign), "string" (a UTF-8 string, not-null
   terminated), or "blob" (arbitrary byte vector).

   Max: Integer - For string and blob variables, the maximum number of bytes that can be stored. For digit,
   signed and unsigned types, the maximum value allowed.

   Min: Integer - For digit, signed and unsigned values, the minimum value allowed.

   Description: Optional String

   Default: value of this Type, required

   Offset: Optional integer offset with in the configuration address space for this item; if not present,
   data is laid out by length in depth-first order.

   A variable may contain zero or one map descriptions. If present, the map represents a mapping between
   possible values (the "Key" part of the map's pairs) and convenient names for them (the "Value" part of
   the map's pairs).

   Note that the current value of a variable is not considered configuration definition information (see
   item 1A and 1B in the introduction).

   Configuration information must not be packed into variables; each variable must represent one type of
   information. In particular, the use of individual bits within larger values to pack multiple pieces of
   information is forbidden; those must be represented as individual variables. (How the information is
   stored internally is up to the designer of the specific device, and is not restricted; this requirement
   is about access to the information, not about how it's laid out in physical memory)

   IV-b) A "producer" description contains:

   Name: String, required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Description: Optional String

   Replication count: Integer >= 1 (number of times this producer definition is replicated within the
   parent item)

   Offset: Optional integer offset with in the configuration address space for this item; if not present,
   data is laid out by length in depth-first order.

   A producer description may contain zero or more variable descriptions for any variables that configure
   details of the producer's function.

   IV-c) A "consumer" description contains:

   Name: String, required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Description: Optional String

   Replication count: Integer >= 1 (number of times this consumer definition is replicated within the
   parent item)

   Offset: Optional integer offset with in the configuration address space for this item; if not present,
   data is laid out by length in depth-first order.

   A consumer description may contain zero or more variable descriptions for any variables that configure
   details of the consumer function. This may include e.g. variables that define how any content in
   incoming messages will be used.

  3.2.3 Serialization

   The logical layout in the previous section has to be converted to some serial set of bytes for transfer
   and storage.

   The primary format is straight-forward XML. (Link to schema)

   Another is compressed binary information. Either an aggressive compression algorithm, or some
   context-aware compression, can be used. Size and ease of expansion are the key criteria; ease of
   compression is much less important. XSLT can do some of the reformatting between compact and readable
   form

   We need to pick one format for a lingua franca.

3.3 Example

   The following is not meant to show how configuration definition information would be stored, but what
   kinds of information would be stored. It's a description of a complex accessory decoder, the Digitrax
   DS54, modified for use in a Producer-Consumer model.

   Hopefully the syntax will be self-explanatory. In any case, it's just for this example, not a proposal
   of any kind.

   Manufacturer (String): Digitrax

   Model (String): DS54

   Version (String): 2.33

   Description (Optional String): For more information, see http://digitrax.com/asdf/123

   Description: This is the board address, in DCC space originally

   Group start: (Note this is nested in "Decoder")

   Name (String): Channel

   Description (Optional String): Each Channel is one pair of output wires and contains two inputs

   Replication count (integer): 4

   Group start: (Note this is nested in "Channel")

   Name (String): Input

   Description (Optional String): Each Channel has two inputs, called "Switch" and "Aux"

   Replication count (integer): 2

   Producer start:

   Name: Switch Input Active

   Description: Driven by the 1st input wire for this channel. The variables control ....

   Min: 0

   Default: 0

   Description: Specify the local action when this input is active

   Map:

   Name: Values

   "0", "Output toggle"

   "1", "No output change"

   "2", "Output thrown"

   ...

   Map End

   Variable End

   Producer end:

   Producer start:

   Name: Aux Input Active

   Description: Driven by the 2nd input wire for this channel. The variables control ....

   Variable:

   Name: Input Type

   Type: Integer

   Max: 10

   Min: 0

   Default: 0

   Description: Specify the type of signal expected on this input

   Map:

   Name: Values

   "0", "positive edge"

   "1", "neither edge"

   "2", "either edge"

   ...

   Map End

   Variable End

   Variable:

   Name: Input Task

   Type: Integer

   Max: 8

   Min: 0

   Default: 0

   Description: Specify the local action when this input is active

   Map:

   Name: Values

   "0", "Output toggle"

   "1", "No output change"

   "2", "Output thrown"

   ...

   Map End

   Variable End

   Producer end:

   Group end: (This is the end of the input group)

   Variable:

   Name: Output Type

   Type: Integer

   Max: 40

   Min: 0

   Default: 0

   Description: Determines what the output leads do in response to events ....

   Name: Turnout Active Thrown

   Description: Set the thrown output lead active and closed lead inactive.

   Consumer end:

   Consumer end:

   Consumer start:

   Name: Turnout Active Both

   Description: Sets both output leads active.

   Consumer end:

   Consumer start:

   Name: Turnout Inactive

   Description: Sets both output leads inactive.

   Consumer end:

   Group end: (This is end of the "Channel" group)

   Group end: (This is end of the "Decoder" group)

   Some thoughts based on putting this example together:

   1) In a real DS54, there are subtle differences between the Switch and Aux configuration choices on the
   various channels. I blurred those here by documenting them identically via replication. For a real
   device, they could either be separately specified or (more likely) the differences wouldn't matter in a
   P/C-based device.

   2) A DS54 can receive messages that put its output into four states: One side on, the other side on,
   both sides on, and neither side on. These four interacts with the "Output Type" setting in weird and
   wonderful ways. This was represented as four consumers. This seems a much more logical way to configure
   the device, as it gives more flexibility to the rest of the layout that's originating the requests.

   3) The DS54 inputs also generate messages. They are specified as two producers (for the active and
   inactive messages).

3.4 Implementation Notes

   This section is non-normative notes and suggestions for implementors.

   Some references for XML compression:

   http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-datacompression/index.html?cmp=dw&cpb=dwxml&ct=dwnew&cr=dwnen&ccy=zz&csr=072111

   http://www.cs.panam.edu/~artem/main/teaching/csci6370spring2011/papers/XML%20compression%20techniques%20A%20survey%20and%20comparison.pdf

   On the other hand, a look-back compression algorithm has the advantage that it's cheap to decompress and
   might do almost as well:

   http://excamera.com/sphinx/article-compression.html

   XML strings can start with a UTF BOM (either 0xEF, 0xFF or 0xFE in the 1^st byte, since there's no need
   to support UTF-32BE or UTF-32LE), or the UTF-8 text for “<?xml” which starts with 0x3C. (But concern
   about support for too many character sets!)

   A first byte of 0x80 is defined as the “Compressed” indicator(s), followed by a byte that indicates the
   compression type. (We don't want to have too many kinds, as receivers need to implement all of them to
   be able to use the CDIFDI!) 0x80 00 is the code for our choice of default, see
   http://excamera.com/sphinx/article-compression.html

                                              4 Remaining items

   Internationalization of the XML content?

   Talk about the encoding string in the <?xml first line, and UTF-8 coding as default; ASCII as subset.

   Mini-XML effort; we're using as simple a subset as possible.
