                                                1 Introduction

   This technical note contains informative discussion and background for the corresponding “OpenLCB Unique
   Identifiers Standard”. This explanation is not normative in any way.

                                        2 Annotations to the Standard

   This section provides background information on corresponding sections of the Standard document. It's
   expected that two documents will be read together.

2.1 Introduction

   Originally, OpenLCB Unique Identifiers was defined in terms of 48-bit unique “Node IDs”.  Other uses
   were found for these identifiers that didn't associate them with a specific node, which demonstrated the
   need for Unique Identifiers beyond just Node IDs.  Therefore, the Standard and this Technical Note are
   generally written in terms of Unique Identifiers, which includes Node IDs usage.

2.2 Intended Use

   The “globally unique” requirement only refers to the universe of connected nodes; nodes that never need
   to communicate with each other need not have separate Node IDs. In general, however, nodes can move:
   they can be sold or loaned for use on another layout, nodes on modular layouts can be connected to other
   arbitrary modules, and few assumptions can be made. It is best if nodes are given a completely unique
   identifier when manufactured, so there's no need to ever detect and resolve a conflict.  If a Node ID
   conflict should occur on an OpenLCB network, the Message Network Standard defines how the conflict
   should be handled.  In general, OpenLCB standards place the effort and burden on preventing a conflict
   from occurring rather than resolving a conflict if and when it does occur.

2.3 References and Context

2.4 Format

   The Standards don't require any particular human-readable format for input and output, but hex-pairs
   with separators (example:  01.AB.34.01.CD.E3) are recommended by the Common Information TN. If any other
   format is used, including decimal pairs, it's very important to make it clear how to interpret it.

   There are many methods to store a Unique Identifier, and there is no constraint placed by the Unique
   Identifier Standard on how a Unique Identifier is stored. It could be stored in a non-volatile memory,
   as jumpers on a board, etc.

2.5 Allocation

  2.5.1 Overview

   Unique Identifiers are assigned via a delegation process. At the highest level, ranges are assigned to
   people and organizations, within which they are responsible for assigning Unique Identifiers to separate
   devices. These ranges can be subdivided and delegated further, as needed. Additional ranges can then be
   requested, which will eventually be recorded in the Unique Identifier Standard or the Unique Identifier
   Appendix as appropriate.  The OpenLCB organization reserves the right to allocate Unique Identifiers
   within a separate database in real-time and periodically update the Unique Identifier Appendix document
   from this database.  In the unlikely event that a conflict shall arise between OpenLCB managed real-time
   database and the Unique Identifiers Appendix, the Unique Identifiers Appendix , document represents the
   true allocation.

   One of the reasons for having a long, 48-bit Unique Identifier space is to make it easier to use a
   delegation system like this.  Because there are a lot of possible Unique Identifiers, large ranges can
   be delegated to groups without having to ensure that the range be efficiently used.  For example, most
   NMRA members will not design their own OpenLCB nodes and need to assign Node IDs, but assigning a range
   to every member makes it easy for those who want to, at a total cost of less than 0.0016% of the
   available Unique Identifier space.

   In the delegated assignments, the lower order byte(s) are self-assigned. Though not strictly required,
   by convention, the value of zero  for the lower self-assigned byte(s) should be reserved, indicating
   that a number within the range hasn't been assigned.

   The high byte of each range is different for each type of assignment, making it easy to determine the
   allocation pattern in use for a particular Unique Identifier.

   Allocations are meant to be unique forever, so the standard requires that new allocation ranges not
   overlap existing ones, and allocation regions not be reused later.

  2.5.2 Reserved Leading Zero

   A Unique Identifier with a most significant value of 0x00 is never valid.  This range is reserved.  A
   message utilizing one of these values must never be sent on the OpenLCB bus.  If a node receives a
   message utilizing a Unique Identifier from this range, it may ignore the message, or throw an error,
   however, it must never act on the message as if it was a valid Unique Identifier.

   The fact that the Unique Identifiers in this range are invalid may be, and often is, exploited within
   the internal software of a node in order to mark an unused, or invalid, Node ID.  This use is private
   and internal to the node and as such is not subject to scrutiny by the OpenLCB standards as long as it
   is not exposed external to the node.

  2.5.3 Well-Known Global Identifiers

   In addition to use as Node Identifiers (Node IDs), OpenLCB Unique Identifiers are used to ensure
   uniqueness of specific global event identifiers and for other purposes.  These numbers must be allocated
   so that they are kept unique.  The identifiers specified in this section are of that type.

   Note that the detailed use of these identifiers is specified elsewhere. In some cases, the protocols are
   still being developed, and the entry here is just reserving a range for a specific future use.

  2.5.4 Manufacturer Specific

   This group of Unique Identifiers is reserved specifically for manufacturers.  Manufacturers may request
   a range of Unique Identifiers for use within their products.  A Manufacturer may assign the Unique
   Identifiers within their allocated range at their own discretion so long as every assignment is unique.

   A manufacturer is not required to assign Unique Identifiers sequentially.  They may choose their own
   arbitrary scheme that could be based on product type, manufacture date, or some other method of their
   choosing.  Though it is strongly recommended for a manufacturer to make reasonably efficient use of
   their self-assigned space, should a manufacturer require additional space, it may be requested, and
   granted, without the requirement of having used every last available Unique Identifier within a
   previously assigned space.  Manufacturers are not required to publicly disclose their allocation scheme
   for Unique Identifiers.

   In order to encourage existing manufacturers to participate in developing OpenLCB products, every DCC
   manufacturer has already been allocated a 24-bit region within which to self-assign Unique Identifiers
   from.  The DIY, JMRI, MERG, and NMRA Reserved spaces are sub-sets of the DCC manufacturer space and are
   consistent with the DCC ID's already assigned for these purposes in the NMRA standards doc “S-9.2.2
   Appendix A, DCC Manufacturer ID Codes”.  They are singled out only for the purpose of drawing attention
   to the fact that they exist and not for any other purpose.

   Only those DCC manufacturers assigned a short (8-bit) DCC manufacturer ID have allocations in this
   region.  For those manufacturers that obtain a long (16-bit) DCC manufacture ID, please see section
   2.5.11.  The result is that those manufacturers who happen to be earlier assignees of a unique DCC
   manufacture ID have a slight advantage in that they have two 24-bit regions assigned to them without
   having to explicit request assignment of a 2nd 24-bit region.  The reason for this is accidental.  It
   was not known to the OpenLCB developers at the time of the first DCC manufacture ID based allocation
   what the scheme for long (16-bit) DCC manufacture ID allocation would be.  When the long (16-bit) DCC
   manufacture allocation scheme became known, it also became clear that this scheme would not fit within
   the unassigned space remaining in the Manufacture Specific region.

   The advantage posed by having two automatically allocated 24-bit DCC manufacture ID based regions is
   negligible.  As stated in section 2.5.1, there is no shortage of 24-bit regions that can be assigned,
   and another 24-bit region can be assigned to any manufacture upon request.

  2.5.5 Self-Assigning Groups

   MERG kit builders and others would like to assign their own identifiers without going through a
   complicated process. To make this possible without any interaction with anybody, these groups are
   assigned identifier ranges that involve their member number in the organization. A member may assign any
   identifier from this range to the node(s) they produce, provided that each identifier is assigned to at
   most one node. A range of 255 identifiers per member is typically sufficient for hobby usage.  Should a
   hobbyist exhaust their assigned range, the hobbyist can get another, larger assignment. It's also
   convenient to give hobbyists a byte as their range.

   Each organization is assigned a unique high-order two bytes. The organization member number is given 24
   bits.   Byte 2 of the Unique Identifier advances by 4 between groups (NMRA is 0x00, MERG is 0x04, etc)
   to allow a little more headroom on group membership numbers; this space can be reclaimed later if
   needed.

   Other groups have defined mechanisms to ensure that their node numbers or equivalent constructs are
   uniquely assigned. They may have non-technical reasons for wishing to use those same mechanisms to
   assign OpenLCB unique identifiers. Ranges of OpenLCB Unique Identifiers can be assigned to these groups,
   so that members may then use their group's mechanism to select a value within that range, the result
   will be a properly unique OpenLCB Unique Identifier.

   The first example of this is MERG CBUS developers. MERG CBUS has defined a “no cost” way of identifying
   unique 16-bit Node Number (NN) for CBUS use, perhaps with an optional 16-bit Layout Number (LN). People
   who wish to use this mechanism to allocate unique OpenLCB Node ID identifiers can, without having to
   consult anybody, generate an OpenLCB Node ID from the unique CBUS number(s) as described in the
   Standard.

   If the user is involved in determining the Unique Identifier for a node (the Node ID) by setting
   switches, the possibility of duplicated Node IDs must be considered. Users make mistakes. To reduce user
   frustration, the node should provide a user-visible way to indicating a duplicate has been seen, and
   should fully implement the relevant wire-protocol-specific methods for detecting duplicate Node IDs.

  2.5.6 Assigned by Software at Runtime

   Programs that act as one or more OpenLCB nodes need to associate unique identifiers with them. For
   licensed software, where a unique key can be associated with each instance of the program, this is easy:
   Use the manufacturer space defined above, and generate the lower bits of a specific ID from the license
   key.

   Free, open and unlicensed software can't use a license-key-based method. Unfortunately, the 48-bit
   address space is too small to use the IP-address-plus-signature GIDs that would otherwise make this a
   simple problem, or the even larger MAC-address-plus-signature GIDs.

   Initial experiments were done using 32-bit IPv4 addresses as components of Unique Identifiers, but this
   is no longer recommended for several reasons:

     * Not all IPv4 addresses are globally unique.  Some IP addresses correspond to “private networks”,
       which are only locally unique.  See RFC 1918 and RFC 3330 for more information.  In addition,
       Microsoft defined a non-IETF “Automatic Private IP Addressing” mechanism for providing non-global IP
       addresses.

     * A single computer may run several programs, so there still needs to be separate mechanism to provide
       a unique value for the lowest bytes of the ID.  That involves a level of coordination across
       multiple software vendors that is hard to imagine.

     * IPv6 is coming.  It provides addresses that are too large to use directly. Even before that happens,
       the various issues of IPv4 to IPv6 mapping raise all sorts of questions about uniqueness of IPv4
       addresses.

     * Even globally routable IPv4 addresses may not be unique over time.  For example, DHCP may assign the
       same address to multiple computers sequentially.  This is particularly an issue with wireless access
       at e.g. clubs and shows.

   Computers that have global Internet access, even if they don't have a permanent and unique IP address,
   can still get a Unique Identifier from an openlcb.org-provided service.  These Unique Identifiers are
   provided from a specified range to ensure that they are unique when created.  Each identifier is only
   provided once to ensure that it remains unique.  Programs using this facility should permanently
   remember Unique Identifiers obtained this way, because they won't get the same one on a later request.

   Other organizations can also distribute Unique Identifiers from within their allocated blocks. For
   example, a Unique Identifier could be provided when a free-software program is downloaded, perhaps as
   part of the download package or even as part of its filename.

   Programs without access to an ID-providing service must use some other mechanism, which may result in
   prompting the user for a Unique Identifier assigned by one of the other mechanisms.

  2.5.7 Specifically Assigned by Request

   Users can request blocks of Unique Identifiers of various sizes.  The small (256) and medium (65536)
   blocks are not scarce resources. Requests for these blocks should be routinely granted once the
   requester has been identified. The 24-bit blocks are slightly scarcer, but there are still almost 216 of
   them available by using additional values for byte 2.  

   An automated system for requesting and obtaining unique ID ranges is available at
   http://registry.openlcb.org and subsequent pages.  

  2.5.8 Locomotive Control Systems

   Though locomotive control was initially beyond the scope of OpenLCB development, later work has defined
   OpenLCB methods for working with existing locomotive control systems.  This section specifies ranges of
   Unique Identifiers that are reserved for the purpose of interfacing with existing locomotive control,
   including how a given Unique Identifier maps into the address space of the existing locomotive control
   system.  Additional details of how these Unique Identifiers are to be used are specified elsewhere, but
   sufficient range has been reserved to allow providing existing locomotive control systems with Unique
   Identifiers.

   The expected use case is for a physical OpenLCB device to provide virtual Node representations with
   Unique Identifiers defined within this space. The virtual Node representations may be static (created
   automatically upon startup of the OpenLCB device) or dynamic (created on demand by mechanisms defined
   elsewhere).

   It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that only one OpenLCB device can exist in the network
   that provides a virtual Node representation of a given Unique Identifier in this space. These Unique
   Identifiers are not expected to be globally unique among all OpenLCB networks, but are expected to be
   unique within the confines of a single OpenLCB network. Manufacturers are encouraged to provide
   guidance, in the form of user facing documentation, to insure that this criteria is met.

   While a Unique Identifier space has been reserved for the MTH DCS system, the details of this system are
   not well known enough at this time to provide greater specificity. Public information about the MTH DCS
   protocol is limited. Manufacturers interested in implementing the MTH DCS system are encouraged to share
   their knowledge of the MTH DCS system and its supported addressing schemes so that this Unique
   Identifier space may become better defined in the future.

  2.5.9 RFID and NFC

   The RFID and NFC Unique Identifiers space is reserved to be used in future standards to be defined
   elsewhere.

  2.5.10 Temporary Assigned by Software at Runtime

   As described in the section 2.5.6 Assigned by Software at Runtime above, there are many reasons for
   which a node may want to be assigned a Unique Identifier at runtime.  This Unique Identifier space is
   specifically designated for temporary (leased) assignment of these Unique Identifiers.  There is a
   contract implied with the assignment between the assigning server and client node that is valid for a
   time period defined by the server.  Once the prescribed time period expires, the client node must cease
   usage of the previously assigned Unique Identifier.

   It is left up to the user to guarantee that there are not two or more servers with the potential to
   assign the same Unique Identifier within a single OpenLCB network.

   The implementation of the client server protocol is not explicitly defined, and currently there is no
   OpenLCB protocol that allows this client/server process to run over an OpenLCB network.  Other
   mechanisms, such as a TCP connection over the Internet may be of use in implementation.  The following
   list suggests implementation details that are not required, but might be considered when designing such
   a client server pair:

     * Lease time can be extended through a renewal process.

     * The server does not reassign a previously assigned and currently expired Unique Identifier until it
       has run through the entire pool allocated to it.

     * The server allows the client to suggest a Unique Identifier that it would like from the server's
       pool.

     * The server have persistent storage of current leases that it can can consult in case of a restart.

     * The client remembers its last Unique Identifier assignment and suggests to the server to be
       re-assigned this Unique Identifier upon reset, power failure, or reconnection to the server
       following a previous disconnect.

   Use this pool with caution.  Implementation mechanisms that make use of this pool are currently
   experimental.  Because Unique Event Identifiers assigned out of this range could be captured and
   disseminated into use by nodes that could become unaware of a lease expiration and reassignment, Unique
   Event Identifiers are not to be assigned out of this range.

  2.5.11 Long (16-bit) NMRA DCC Manufacture Specific

   When it became known that the long (16-bit) NMRA DCC manufacture ID space would not fit within the
   unassigned space of the Manufacture Specific region described in section 2.5.4, this region was reserved
   to be assigned to DCC manufacturers with a long (16-bit) DCC manufacture ID.  Because all short (8-bit)
   DCC manufacturer IDs can all be represented as valid long (16-bit) DCC manufacture IDs by having the
   most significant of the long (16-bit) DCC manufacture ID set to 0x00, those manufacturers with a short
   (8-bit) DCC manufacture ID have two 24-bit allocations assigned to them without having to explicitly
   request any additional allocation.

  2.5.12 Reserved Unique Identifiers

   For error detection, we permanently reserve all identifiers that start with either a 0x00 or 0xFF value.
   OpenLCB implementations should, but are not required to, treat it as an error when any of those are
   encountered.

                                         3 Implementation Information

   Specific Unique Identifier assignments are stored in a MySQL database, and the full list of assignments,
   including overall ranges from the standard and ranges assigned for specific purposes and users can be
   found on the http://registry.openlcb.org website.  

   Automated allocation systems can be abused, and we don't want to give away large chunks of address space
   to automated requesters.  All available information about requests is logged. Users are asked for their
   name and contact information at the time of the request, which is also logged.  Depending on experience
   with requests, an email challenge-response or other mechanism to ensure only valid requests get
   allocations may need to be added in the future.

   Because of the inherent difficulties in protecting an SQL or other Internet accessible databases from
   abuse, both intentionally malicious and unintentional, an Unique Identifier Appendix document will
   periodically be generated for the purposes of archival to a higher integrity revision control system.
    The Unique Identifier Appendix document is the final authority on assignments should the SQL database
   become corrupted creating a discrepancy between the two.
