                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This working note covers the Traction Protocol, the way that OpenLCB handles moving objects such as
   locomotives, engines, and other rolling stock.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   The Traction Protocol covers the interaction between one (or more) Throttles and one or more Trains, as
   this interaction is represented on the OpenLCB bus. There can be more than one Throttles controlling a
   single Train, and more than one Trains being controlled by a single Throttle (also called consisting).
   The Throttle, as a Node on the OpenLCB bus, may be either a physical throttle, or a Gateway converting
   messages of a different throttle protocol to OpenLCB. The Train is also represented as a Node on the
   OpenLCB bus; this may be a physical decoder present in a locomotive and capable of participating in the
   OpenLCB network (presumably via wireless communication), or it may be a Gateway device translating the
   OpenLCB Traction Protocol to some other method of controlling trains. The most important example of such
   other method is the DCC track protocol, in which case the Gateway device is commonly referred to as a
   DCC Command Station.

   For more information on format and presentation, see:

     * OpenLCB Common Information Technical Note.

   For information on OpenLCB message transport and OpenLCB communications, see:

     * OpenLCB Message Network Standard.

   A Node implementing the Traction Protocol must implement:

     * OpenLCB Event Transport Standard;

     * OpenLCB Simple Node Information Protocol Standard.

   The following protocols are strongly recommended to be implemented by any Train node:

     * OpenLCB Memory Configuration Standard and Datagram Protocol it depends on;

     * OpenLCB Configuration Description Information Standard

     * OpenLCB Train Search Protocol

   Float-16 is the half-precision numeric format defined by IEEE 754-2008. This is the format that the GNU
   toolchain's -mfp16-format=ieee flag and __fp16 type makes available on some CPU types.

3.1 Terminology

   The following Nodes participate in the interactions presented in this Standard:

     * Train Node: A Train is represented by a single, specific Node. To control that specific Train,
       OpenLCB messages are sent addressed to that Node. It is not a requirement that the hardware
       operating the given Train Node be mechanically installed in the specific Train.

     * Throttle Node: An OpenLCB Node controlling one or more Train Nodes using the Traction Protocol. It
       is not a requirement that the hardware operating the Throttle Node be mechanically installed into
       the physical throttle that the operator is using. A single OpenLCB Node may have independent
       interactions with multiple Train Nodes, and thus represent more than one physical throttle.

   The following additional concepts are used:

     * Controller: A Train Node may have a single Throttle Node assigned as the Controller. There is no
       requirement that the Train Node should only accept control commands from the Controller. A Throttle
       Node set as the Controller has to stay alive and connected to the OpenLCB bus, and the Train Node
       may periodically verify this as a safety check.

     * Listener: A Throttle Node may be interested in receiving a copy of all state changing messages from
       a given Train Node. Since Throttle-to-Train configuration is addressed, there is no network-level
       mechanism to guarantee that messages destined to the Train Node can be intercepted by the interested
       third party. The Train Node therefore has a feature that allows other nodes to be registered, and
       the Train shall forward the speed (and optionally function) setting messages to the registered
       Listener nodes. A way to achieve consisting is to specify the consist members as listeners on the
       lead engine's train node, or to allocate a virtual node and specify all engines as listeners to that
       virtual node.

   The Set Function instruction uses a three-byte address for brevity; it's to be interpreted with a high
   byte of zero to make a four byte address in the function memory space (0xFA).

   The P bit shall be set to 0 when a Throttle Node sends a command to a Train Node, and set to 1 when a
   Train Node is sending a forwarded command to a Listener Node.

   The Query Speed/Direction reply is almost in the Set Speed/Direction format, with the addition of the
   two additional speeds.  If a node cannot provide any of those three speeds, it shall use float16 NaN
   (not a number) 0xFFFF. “Set Speed” is the most recent speed received in a Set Speed/Direction
   instruction, or ±0 if an E-Stop command was received after the last Set Speed/Direction command. The
   E-Stop bit in the Flags byte represents whether the Train Node is in Emergency Stop state. “Commanded
   Speed” is the speed that the traction control is currently attempting to move, taking into account
   momentum and any other control modifiers.  “Actual Speed” is the current measured speed of the
   locomotive. There is no accuracy guarantee for Actual Speed.

                                             5 States (Normative)

   OpenLCB Train Nodes have the following states:

   Related to Speed:

     * Set Speed – The speed set by a throttle, the content of the most recent “set speed” instruction

     * Commanded Speed – the current speed that is intended by the control algorithm of the Train Node.

     * Current Speed – a physical state, the speed at which the object is currently moving.

   Related to Emergency Stop:

     * A Train Node enters Emergency Stop state upon receiving a Traction Control Command message with
       Emergency Stop command. A Train Node leaves Emergency Stop state upon receiving a Traction Control
       Command message with a Set Speed command (for any speed, including ±0).

     * A Train Node enters Global Emergency Stop state upon receiving an Event Report message with the
       Emergency Stop All event. A Train Node leaves Global Emergency Stop state upon receiving an Event
       Report message with the Clear Emergency Stop All event.

     * A Train Node enters Global Emergency Off state upon receiving an Event Report message with the
       Emergency Off All event. A Train Node leaves Global Emergency Off state upon receiving an Event
       Report message with the Clear Emergency Off All event.

   Related to Functions:

     * It is not specified, which Function numbers are part of the state of the Train Node, and for those
       that are, what resolution the value needs to be represented.

   Related to Listeners:

     * The state consists of which Listeners are currently attached (their Node ID), the Flag byte with
       which they were last attached, and the order in which they were attached. Updating the flags shall
       not change the order.

     * It is strongly recommended to store the Listener configuration in persistent state.

   Related to Controller:

     * The state consists of a single Node ID, which may be unset.

                                          6 Interactions (Normative)

6.1 Train Assignment

   Controller configuration maintains the node that is controlling the train node. In order to operate a
   train the controller must be first assigned.  A train node shall not respond to a traction message if it
   not defined as the current active Controller.  Once a controller is finished operating a train it
   should, but is not required, to Release the active Controller.  One place this may not be done is if the
   controller is being unplugged to be moved to a new location on the layout.  The benefit of releasing the
   train is to allow the next controller to be connected to the train without the handshaking required to
   take a train from an existing active Controller.  This is explained in the messaging diagram later in
   this document.  A Controller node may be send an unsolicited message if it is currently assigned to a
   train node and another Controller node attempts to assign itself to the train.  The new the Controller
   node requests to be Assigned to the train one of several actions may occur.

    1. The train may block the request and return false to the Assign request

    2. The train forwards a Controller Changed Notify message to the currently assigned controller node and
       that controller node returns false in which the train node returns false with a fail code of
       Controller Refused to the Assign request.  The active controller may, but is not required to,
       indicate to the user it has been asked to release the train node.

    3. The train forwards a Controller Changed Notify message to the currently assigned controller node and
       that controller node return true.  The active controller may, but is not required to, indicate to
       the user it is loosing its position as the active controller of the train node.  In turn the train
       node returns true to the Assign request and the train node sets the new controller as the active
       controller.

   A node may Query the active node from a train node.  If no controller is assigned the train nodes
   returns a Node ID of 0.0.0.0.0.0.

   Traction Management locks/releases the train node such that interactions that require multiple messages
   between 2 or more nodes are guaranteed to be completed before another node can set (modify) the
   configuration on the train node.  These messages are not needed for normal traction operations such as
   speed and function set/query.  If the node attempting to set attributes of the train is not the active
   node the train node will ignore the request and as such locking/releasing is not required.

6.2 Emergency Stop

   Receipt of the Emergency Stop instruction stops the locomotive as fast as possible.  This sets the set
   speed to zero (preserving existing direction) and the commanded speed to zero (preserving existing
   direction) regardless of any momentum, BEMF or other operations with the train node.

   Emergency stop is not a specific state.  The next Set Speed/Direction instruction will act immediately
   to change the set speed, and start the commanded speed and actual speed moving toward that set speed.

6.3 Function Operation

   Function values are stored in the 0xF9 memory space. They are written using the memory configuration
   protocol or using the Set Function instruction.

6.4 Train Configuration

   Trains are OpenLCB nodes just like any other. As such, the Memory Configuration protocol can be used to
   configure them, the Configuration Description Information system can be used to make that process user
   friendly, etc. There's nothing traction-specific in these techniques, which are available any time that
   the train node is connected to the OpenLCB.

    

6.5 Train Identification

   OpenLCB Train nodes use:

     * The Event Transport protocol to locate Train nodes

     * PIP for enquiry about the support

     * SNII and/or Memory configuration, CDI & ACDI for identification of a specific train node.

   Trains are OpenLCB nodes just like any other. As such, they can take part in protocols such as Node
   Verification and Simple Node Information which allows other nodes to learn about them.

   Train Acquisition Protocol is necessary because the train operator doesn't want to pick up a throttle
   and enter “06.011.00.02.1F.2D” (a node ID), or even “110 Long” (a DCC address), but rather just pick the
   desired locomotive from a list of those available. (A throttle should still allow the operator to
   directly enter the address, when that's what the operator wants to do.)

   The train acquisition process simplifies locating desired train nodes so that small hand-held throttle
   nodes can efficiently take part. It does this using several approaches, which can be used as needed by
   throttles:

     * Events are used to announce the existence and status of Train nodes

     * Train nodes will generally implement the Simple Node Information protocol so that throttles can get
       basic, user-readable identification from them

     * A search protocol is (being) defined to make it possible to locate individual Train nodes without
       having to read information from all of them

   So that other nodes can find them, Train nodes must produce the well-known reserved event
   01.01.00.00.00.00.03.03. This means they must produce that event in a Producer/Consumer Event Report
   message when they power up, and reply to requests for producers of that event. An IdentifyProducer
   request will therefore find all the train nodes on the OpenLCB, and further protocols can be used to get
   additional information on the individual Train nodes it locates.

   SNIP will be used to carry both manufacturer-provided and user-provided information about the particular
   train node. In particular, the user (Node) Name and (Node) Description fields are to be used to hold
   train identification information that can be retrieved and presented by throttles for selection.

6.8 Throttle to Throttle Successful Hand-over (steal)

6.9 Listeners

   graphics5

   When listeners are configured, the incoming state changing traction messages are forwarded by the train
   node to all the listener nodes. The forwarded message shall be a Traction Control Request message.

   If the source node of the message is on the listener list, the message is not forwarded to avoid message
   loops.

   The listener flags define what messages shall be forwarded:

     * Set speed message is always forwarded. If the flag “Rev direction” is set for the listener, the
       direction of the forwarded speed is flipped.

     * Set function message with function number = 0 is forwarded iff the “Link F0” flag is set on the
       listener configuration.

     * Set function messages for all other function numbers shall be forwarded iff the “Link Fn” flag is
       set on the listener configuration.

   To add or remove a listener, the Attach Node or Detach Node message shall be sent to the target train
   node. The response shall contain the same node ID and a 2-byte OpenLCB Error Code. The following error
   codes may be helpful:

     * 0x1030: Permanent error, Not found. Useful if the caller tried to remove a node that is not attached
       as a listener.

     * 0x1032: Permanent error, Already Exists. Useful if the caller tried to add a node as a listener to
       itself.

   If a caller wants to update the flags of a specific listener, the Attach Node message shall be sent with
   the same node ID and the new flags.

   To query the listeners from a train node, a Listener configuration Query Nodes message shall be sent to
   the train node. The response message contains the number of listeners currently configured. Listeners
   are indexed from 0 to count-1. Sending the Query Nodes message with the index specified, the train node
   will return the information for that specific listener, including Node ID and the flags specifying the
   forwarding options. If the requested index is out of bounds, or no index is requested, then the response
   will be short (no node information).

   User interfaces that show the listeners shall not show listener nodes that are marked with the flag
   “Hide”. This flag is intended to be set for controlling throttles and train automation systems.

   To discover and retrieve all listeners from a train node, multiple query messages are required. This
   presents a race condition when a third node changes the listener configuration during the process. It is
   not specified how the listener indexes change by attaching or detaching a listener. The querying node
   can recognize that their information is out of date by observing a change in the count of listeners
   compared to the expected number of listeners and restart the enumeration process.

6.10 Heartbeat

   The Heartbeat Request may be sent by a train node to the currently active Controller node at the
   discretion of the train node.  The argument is a deadline in seconds for the Controller node to reply.
   The Controller node may reply with any control or query command, or a No-op command. If there is no
   command received within the deadline, the train node may elect to stop the train.

   Trains shall not initiate a heartbeat request if the last Set Speed is zero (including E-stop).

   Trains shall accept any command or query sent from the controller node to the train node to clear the
   heartbeat request. If the controller node does not have anything to command or query, the Traction
   Management No-op request may be used to clear the heartbeat.

   If a train does not receive any command or query from the Controller node within the deadline presented
   in the heartbeat request, the train shall interpret that as a Set Speed 0 command. This command shall be
   forwarded to any registered listeners at the same time.

   In case there is no assigned Controller node, there is no connection to check with heartbeats, and the
   train shall continue operating as last commanded. Controllers can choose to release themselves from the
   train if they wish to not receive heartbeats; this is recommended during any orderly shutdown of a
   controller or else the train will stop after the heartbeat period.

                                               7 Memory Spaces

7.1 Configuration Information

   The configuration memory space holds the configuration of the train, such as how functions will work,
   how speed in scale meters/second will control motor operation, etc.

7.2 CDI

7.3 Function Information 0xF9

   Functions, such as lights and sounds, can be operated by the Traction Control Set Function instruction,
   and their current value can be retrieved via the Traction Control Query Function instruction.

   The NMRA 9.2.1 Recommended Practice describes DCC as having three separate sets of "functions". The
   OpenLCB 0xF9 space is allocated to cover all these by using the third byte of the address as a selector.

   Type                       Low Address High Address Values                           
                                                       A non-zero value indicates "ON", 
   F0-F28                     0x0 00 00   0x0 00 1C                                     
                                                       a zero value is "OFF".           
   Binary State Controls                                                                
                              0x1 00 00   0x1 7F FF    "
   (full space)               
   Binary State Controls                                                                
                              0x2 00 00   0x2 00 7F    "
   (short space, if separate) 
   Analog Outputs             0x3 00 00   0x3 00 FF                                     

   The default Function Definition Information, when nothing is known about a particular decoder's
   capabilities, will just describe these as above. If the node serving the DCC decoder information knows
   more about the particular decoder's capabilities and/or preferred labeling, it can provide more
   information via the Function Definition Information.

    

7.4 Function Definition Information FDI 0xFA

   “Function Definition Information”, similar in intent to Configuration Definition Information (CDI) is
   stored in XML format in address space 0xFA to provide user-oriented context. That includes:

     * Memory layout of the function values, allowing for multiple data types from binary (one and off for
       lights) through integer values (for e.g. sound intensities) and strings (sign displays?).

     * Function naming, so that a throttle can display useful names to the user such as "Bell", "Coupler
       Clank" and "Master Volume".
