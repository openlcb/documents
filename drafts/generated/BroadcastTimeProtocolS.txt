                                                   Sep 11, 2018                        Preliminary          

                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   “Fast clock” is a model railroading concept, where the layout is modeling a particular time, which can
   then be used for various purposes, such as running trains according to a timetable, or displaying
   lighting effects based on time of day. Fast-time is defined as time that progresses at a different rate
   (typically faster) than real world time. A layout control bus can do a number of useful things with
   fast-timethe modeled time information:

     * Connect a number of clock displays to keep them synchronized.

     * Provide time displays on plug-in devices, e.g. throttles.

     * Provide cueing for time-based occurrences, such as lights turning on and off at specific modeled
       times.

   Generally, existing fast clock systems have one unit that produces time information, here called a clock
   generator, and one or more units that consume it. s systemExisting fast clockIt is typically
   sufficitnesufficient only to report minutes, not seconds or finer time divisions. Some existing fast
   clock systems track a day/date, in addition to time.

   Fast clocks run at various rates, and can be controlled by the user either at the producer nodeclock
   generator or from other locations. Some fast clock systems broadcast run/stop and rate information,
   which can also be useful when interpolating within a fast-minute or between time sync Eventsbroadcasting
   messages.

   The OpenLCB protocol presented in this doucmentdocument broadcasts time information by producing Eevents
   with a specific structure of IIDs. Specific Event IDs, corresponding to specific times within the day,
   for example “08:10:00”,. so thatThis allows consumers can to be taught to react to time-of-day. The year
   and date are handled separately, for those installations that choose to use it.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   The primary use of this information is to display timeit on clock faces around the layout.

   Since remote control of the fast clock is desired, a set-protocolprotocol for setting up the time
   producer using produced and consumed events is defined. This makes it possible for throttles and other
   nodes with user- interface nodes to have a general fast-clock-control capability built in.

   In addition, simple nodes can use specific EventIDs to trigger their actions at specific times. For
   example, lights in buildings in a model town can be sequenced to come on at various times by configuring
   consumers in a node to react to time events by changing output lines. Most importantly, in this use
   case, the consuming node does not need to be aware that the event is related to time.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   This specification is in the context of the following OpenLCB-CAN Standards:

     * OpenLCB Event Transport Standard, which defines messages for transporting Event IDs and identifying
       producers and consumers.

     * The OpenLCB Event Identifiers Standard, which defines the format and content of Event IDs including
       the class of Well-Known Event IDs and Automatically-Routed Event IDs.

     * OpenLCB Unique Identifiers Standard, which defines the allocation of OpenLCB 48-bit unique
       identifiers.

   For more information on format and presentation, see:

     * OpenLCB Common Information Technical Note

                                        4 Message Formats (Normative)

   This Standard defines a number of Event IDs. as 0x01.01.00.00.00.00.05.01..he well-known event ID
   “Delivers Clock Protocol” is definedTIn addition to the following Event IDs, t

   The upper six bytes of the event IDs defined in the following subsections shall be one of the following:

     * 01.01.00.00.01.00 – referred to as “Default Fast Clock”

     * 01.01.00.00.01.01 – referred to as “Default Real-time Clock”

     * 01.01.00.00.01.02 – referred to as “Alternate Clock 1”

     * 01.01.00.00.01.

     * The upper six bytes of the following messages must be the valid Node ID of the clock producing node.

   Note that there are no well-defined values of the clock event IDs. You locate the clock generators and
   their event spaces via the usual IdentifyEvent/IdentifyProducer mechanisms starting with the “Delivers
   Clock Protocol” event ID.

     * The details of the following formats are still being worked out. 03 – referred to as “Alternate
       Clock 2”

     * a valid unique ID under the control of the manufacturer of the clock generator node

     * a valid Uunique ID under the control of the person or organization configuring the clock generator
       node

   The values are packed into two bytes to make it easier to allocate the unique “Specific Upper Part”; it
   is required to be the Node ID of the clock generator.The upper six bytes are referred to as the
   “Specific Upper Part” in the subsections below.

4.1 Set/Report Time Event ID

    Byte 0       Byte 1       Byte 2      Byte 3      Byte 4      Byte 5      Byte 6           Byte 7       

    Specific Upper Part                                                       Hours            Minutes      
                                                                              0x00-0x1723      0-59         

   The upper nibble of byte 6 is only 0 or 1, which can be used to distinguish this format.

   These event IDs represent time in 24-hour format, i.e. byte 6 values of 0–11 represent a.m. time, and
   values of 12–23 represent p.m. time.

4.2 Set/Report Date Event ID

    Byte 0       Byte 1      Byte 2      Byte 3      Byte 4      Byte 5      Byte 6             Byte 7      

    Specific Upper Part                                                      0x240+Month        Day

   The upper nibble of byte 6 is 24, which can be used to distinguish this format.

4.3 Set/Report Year Event ID

    Byte 0       Byte 1       Byte 2       Byte 3       Byte 4       Byte 5       Byte 6       Byte 7       

    Specific Upper Part                                                           0x3000+Year  
                                                                                               
                                                                                  0x3000-0x3FFF

   The upper nibble of byte 6 is 3, which can be used to distinguish this format.

   The lower twelve bits are the year, 0AD to 4095AD. (It's been proposed that these instead be in some BCD
   format, which represents 999 years around some epoch)

4.4 Set/Report Rate Event ID

    Byte 0       Byte 1       Byte 2       Byte 3       Byte 4       Byte 5       Byte 6       Byte 7       

    Specific Upper Part                                                           0x45000+Rate 

   The upper nibble of byte 6 is 45, which can be used to distinguish this format.

   Rate is a 12 bit signed fixed point rrrrrrrrrr.rr, -512.00, -511.75, -511.00, …, -1.00, …, -0.025, .00,
   0.0, 0.25, 0.50, ..., 511.75  (Is that the right range? Enough granularity? Would something simpler be
   easier?)

   A rate of zero is valid. The stop/start clock event should be used to stop and start the clock, because
   that doesn't require resetting, or even knowing, the current rate.

   (should one bit be reserved, perhaps in the high nibble, to carry the run/stop state when reporting the
   rate? That was in an earlier proposal, makes it easier to look for the entire state in a single event,
   but it's got messy semantics)

   The upper nibble of byte 6 is only 5 or 6, which can be used to distinguish this format.

4.5 Set Time Event ID

    Byte 0       Byte 1       Byte 2       Byte 3      Byte 4      Byte 5      Byte 6          Byte 7       

    Specific Upper Part                                                            Hours         Minutes    
                                                                                 0x80-0x+97       0-59      

   The upper nibble of byte 6 is only 8 or 9, which can be used to distinguish this format.

   These event IDs represent time in 24-hour format, i.e. byte 6 values of 0x80+(0 to 11) represent a.m.
   time, and values of 0x80+(12 to 23) represent p.m. time.

4.6 Set Date Event ID

    Byte 0       Byte 1       Byte 2       Byte 3       Byte 4      Byte 5      Byte 6          Byte 7      

    Specific Upper Part                                                         0xA0+Month      Day         
                                                                                0xA1-0xAC       1-31

   (Could have also put into higher part of e.g. month message, to save this code space)

   Having a separate start/stop mechanism, instead of just setting rate to zero, makes distributed
   start/stop control easier. There's no need for everybody to remember the current rate while the clock is
   stopped.All undefined byte 6 and byte 7 values are reserved for future use. They shall not be sent. If
   received, they shall be ignored.

                                             5 States (Normative)

   Each clock has an independent current time, independent running/stopped state and an independent rate.

   When the clock is in stopped state, it’s internal time is not changing.

   When the clock is in running state, it’s internal time is advancing (<rate> X)times as fast as normal
   time.

                                          6 Interactions (Normative)

6.1 Startup

   When a clock generator starts to operate, it shall send a Producer Range Identified and a Consumer Range
   Identified message covering the whole 16-bit range of the clock’s 6-byte “Specific Upper Part”.
   eitherexactly oneClock consumers shall send either a Consumer Range Identified message covering the
   whole 16-bit range of the clock’s 6-byte “Specific Upper Part” or individual Consumer Identified
   messages for each individual time event consumed.

   Clock Generator

   When a clock on a clock generator is started (from a previously stopped or power up state), upon
   reception of a Latch Settings Event, or upon reception of a Identify producer message for the Event ID
   XX.XX.XX.XX.XX.XX.00.00, it shall produce the following events in the following specific order
   representing a single atomic time:

    1. Report Rate

    2. Report Year

    3. Report Date

    4. One of the following events

   Report Intermediate Time, if the seconds count is not equal to zeroWhen a clock generator starts to
   operate, it shall also send the sequence specified in section 6.3 below as if a Query Event  had been
   received.

6.2 Clock Report

   While running, a clock generator shall send a Report Time Event no more frequently than  once per real
   world minute and no less frequently than once per real world hour with the following exceptions:

    1. The interaction described in section 6.3 below requires it.

    2. The clock generator has previously received a Consumer Identified message for a specific Report
       Year, Date, or Time Event, in which case it will always generate this event when appropriate.

   It is the responsibility of clock consumers to keep track of intermediate time between Report Time
   Events. The standard purposely does not define how a clock consumer internally implements time.

   While running, a clock generator shall send a Date Rollover Event immediately prior to a rollover in the
   progression of time toin either direction through hour 0 and minute 0 and three real seconds later send
   Report Year and Report Date Events.

6.3 Clock Query

   If a clock generator receives a Query Event, it shall respond with the following sequence of messages
   with the last valid events of the given group, in this specific order:Producer Identified Valid messages
   corresponding to each of the last valid clock Stop or Start, Report Rate, Report Year, Report Date, and
   Report Time Events. The clock generator shall also schedule the next time event to be produced
   regardless as to whether a consumer of it has been identified.

    1. Event ,Event Producer Identified Valid for Start or Stop Event ID,

    2. Event Producer Identified Valid for Report Rate event,

    3. Event Producer Identified Valid for Report Year event,

    4. Event Producer Identified Valid for Report Date event,

    5. Event Producer Identified Valid for Report Time event,

    6. Producer/Consumer Event Report for Report Time event for next minute (, when it becomes valid).

6.4 Clock Set

   Any node may configure a clock generator.

   If a Set Rate Event is received by the clock generator, the clock generator's rate may be, but is not
   required to be, set to the rate embedded in the event. If the clock producer does not support the
   requested rate, it shall move to the closest non-zero supported rate. The rate may be set while the
   clock is running or stopped.

   Any node may configure a clock generator. If a Start or Stop, Set Rate, Set Year, Set Date, or Set Time
   Event is received, the clock generator shall makes the change effective immediately, and  sending
   produce the effective Report Rate, Report Year, Report Date, or Report Time Event. Three seconds after
   the last Start or Stop, Set Rate, Set Year, Set Date, and/or Set Time has been received, the sequence of
   messages defined in section 6.3 above shall be sent.

   When a clock producer node receives an IdentifyProducers message that covers any of the events it
   handles (Set/Report Time, Set/Report Date, Set/Report Year, Set/Report Rate, Stop/Start Clock) it will
   reply with a ProducerIdentified message showing valid. If the queried event is the current state (same
   time, same date, same year, same rate & start/stop status, or same start/stop status respectively), the
   reply will be marked active. Otherwise, it will be marked inactive.

   When a clock producer node receives an IdentifyConsumers message that covers any of the events it
   handles (Set/Report Time, Set/Report Date, Set/Report Year, Set/Report Rate, Stop/Start Clock) it will
   reply with a ConsumerIdentified message showing valid. If the queried event is the current state (same
   time, same date, same year, same rate & start/stop status, or same start/stop status respectively), the
   reply will be marked active. Otherwise, it will be marked inactive.

6.5 Event Identification and Reporting

   The use of the same event to broadcast the rate and to set the rate should perhaps be revisited. Is that
   consistent with event semantics? Or should a “rate set event” do the set and cause the clock source to
   emit a “current rate” event? There's no security issue here, because we receive the Node ID of the
   set-sending node either way. And a clock receiving a set command, no matter what the format, can still
   decide not to do it (if the protocol allows rejecting that, see above) The clock producer node may, but
   is not required to, produce a Set/Report Time immediately after the rate event is produced to ensure
   that all agree on the exact time. be set while the clock is running or stopped. The rate mayRate can to
