                                             1 TitleIntroduction

   This Technical Note addresses topics of interest to people designing and implementing gateways between
   OpenLCB segments. It is not normative in any way.

                                           5 General Considerations

   What do you have to forward? What/when can you omit?

   (Broadcast vs reply to request)

   Initialization Complete may be a candidate for omission, particularly at startup when a lot happen at
   once. But if a gateway fails to deliver them, certain operations will be impossible e.g. contact new
   nodes automatically when they first come up.

   Omitting PCER messages is right out; they must be delivered, because there's no way to get them to be
   resent.

   Datagrams and streams have support build in for a temporarily failure to deliver. The protocol just has
   to be obeyed.

   Startup and other Global Traffic

   5K node analysis. Start up time.

   MTI remap and reformatting. Size and buffering.

   Speed Mismatch. Handling and reporting overruns. (Ken Cameron interested in reporting; Event-based
   mechanism?) This is the start of gateway-to-gateway protocols.

                                        6 CAN-specific Considerations

   Use of alias pools. Alias reuse.

   Alias allocation time for large pools.

   Datagram and Stream rebuffering.
