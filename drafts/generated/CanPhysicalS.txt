                                                                   CAN Physical Layer

                                                        Feb 6, 2016                       Draft             

                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This document defines the physical layer for carrying OpenLCB-CAN over a single Controller Area Network
   (CAN) bus. It it not otherwise normative.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Conforming OpenLCB CAN nodes can be connected by cables to form a linear CAN bus with optional short
   stubs. OpenLCB CAN nodes generally have two RJ45 modular connectors and can be daisy-chained together
   with suitable computer-network (“Ethernet”) cables. A CAN terminator is installed by the user at each
   end of the main bus.

   A limited amount of power can be distributed via the cable, allowing a few nodes to draw their power
   from a nearby (less than 20 ft / 6m) source attached to the common bus.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   Cables, including cables attached to nodes, shall carry conductors 1 & 2 as a pair, and conductors 3 & 6
   as a pair.

   Cables may, but are not required to, carry conductors 4 and 5. Conductors 4 and 5, if present, shall be
   carried as a pair.

   Cables may, but are not required to, carry conductors 7 and 8. Conductors 7 and 8, if present, shall be
   carried as a pair.

   If a node provides two or more connections, conductors 1 through 8 shall be provided on all connections.
   Conductors 1 through 7 shall be connected in parallel on all connections. If the node does not provide
   power on pin 8 on all connectors, pin 8 on all connectors shall be connected in parallel. All wiring
   discussed in this paragraph shall be rated to carry at least 1A.

   Nodes shall connect conductors 3 and 6 . This connection shall be rated to carry at least 1A.

   A node may, but is not required to, connect conductor 7 with conductors 3 and 6. Nodes that require
   conductor 7 to be connected to conductors 3 and 6 for proper operation shall connect conductor 7 to
   conductors 3 and 6.

   Voltages of up to 27volts AC or either polarity DC on the ALT_L / ALT_H conductors 4 and 5 shall not
   damage the node nor prevent normal operation of the node.

   Voltages of up to 27 volts AC or either polarity DC on the PWR_NEG / PWR_POS conductors shall not
   permanently damage the node.

                                         5 Data Transport (Normative)

   Data shall be transferred using a CAN signal at 125kbps and CAN frame protocol.

   Any devices providing bus termination shall conform to CAN requirements for that termination.

   A node may, but is not required to, provide a method for bus termination as part of the node. If so,
   there shall be a user-accessible method for enabling and disabling the termination, and the node shall
   be shipped from the original manufacturer with the termination disabled.

                                               6 ALT_L / ALT_H

   The ALT_L / ALT_H pins 4 and 5 are available for alternate uses. This section describes the currently
   approved uses for the ALT_L / ALT_H conductors. Additional uses may be approved and added to this
   document in the future. All uses of ALT_L/ALT_H shall be visibly labeled on the node, and documented in
   the accompanying product literature.

6.1 DCC Signal

   NMRA standard S-9.1.2 defines the “Power Station Interface” for DCC power stations, more commonly known
   as DCC boosters. ALT_L / ALT_H may, but are not required to, be used to carry the “Power Station
   Interface” signals as described in NMRA standard S-9.1.2.

   An OpenLCB node that is a source or consumer of the DCC signal shall conform to the requirements in NMRA
   standard S-9.1.2 in order to be considered in compliance with this standard. The requirements in NMRA
   standard S-9.1.2 are not applicable to OpenLCB nodes that do not source or consume a DCC signal.

   Though the NMRA standard S-9.1.2 allows for a unipolar signal, an OpenLCB source node shall only be
   permitted to use a bipolar signal, ALT_L shall be the “negative” voltage and ALT_H shall be the
   “positive” voltage during the first half of a DCC bit as described in the NMRA standard S-9.1.2. The
   polarity shall be reversed during the second half of the DCC bit.

   ALT_L and ALT_H shall not have a connection to CAN_GND, CAN_SHEILD, PWR_NEG, or any other signal in the
   physical interconnection described in section 4 that is less than 20K ohms impedance at frequencies up
   to 1 MHz in any DCC signal consumer node.

   DCC signal source nodes shall reference ALT_L / ALT_H to PWR_NEG. DCC signal source nodes shall not
   drive ALT_L / ALT_H to exceed +/-22 volts as referenced to each other or to PWR_NEG measured at the DCC
   signal source node into a 1K load.

   A node that either sources or consumes the DCC signal shall be permanently labeled as such in a location
   visible to the user. Nodes that do not supply or consume the DCC signal do not require labeling, even
   though all nodes are required to pass through the ALT_L / ALT_H signals, regardless as to whether they
   consume or source these signals.

                                        7 Supply of Power (Normative)

   A node may, but is not required to, provide power to the cable PWR_POS / PWR_NEG conductors.

   If a node provides power, it shall provide at least 9VDC and no more than 15VDC from zero current draw
   up to its specified maximum current. Its specified maximum current shall not exceed 500 mA. The
   specified maximum current shall be permanently written on the node in a location visible to the user.
   This label is required whether or not the node provides power to the cable.

                                      8 Consumption of Power (Normative)

   Nodes may, but are not required to, draw power from the PWR_POS / PWR_NEG conductors in the cable. Nodes
   shall not draw more than 500 mA at any PWR_POS / PWR_NEG voltage from 7.5VDC to 15VDC. Nodes that draw
   power shall operate properly with a supply voltage of 7.5VDC to 15VDC on the PWR_POS / PWR_NEG
   conductors. The maximum current drawn by each node shall be permanently written on that node in a
   location visible to the user. This label is required whether or not the node draws power from the cable.

                                       9 Injection Current (Normative)

   In addition to the current and voltage requirements placed on the individual conductors of the Physical
   Interconnection signals elsewhere in this document, the current on all eight conductors going into and
   out of a node shall sum to zero. In order to account for measurement tolerances, for testing purposes,
   zero current shall be defined as “zero +/-1mA”.
