                                                1 Introduction

   A Working Note is an intermediate step in the documentation process.  It gathers together the content
   from various informal development documents, discussions, etc into a single place.  One or more Working
   Notes form the basic for the next step, which is one or more Standard/TechNote pairs.

   This working note is the start of effort toward a general location service protocol which can be used by
   e.g. RFID and QR scanners and other detectors to publish information about the detected location of
   rolling stock. It uses event transfer with payload to globally distribute information about
   location-specific information from the layout.

   A “location” is a point on the layout, a block of track, or an area of a layout for which a location
   report may be generated by a scanner or another type of node. There may be multiple scanners or nodes
   that generate or modify location reports for the same location.

1.1 Served Use Cases

    1. A train enters a current-detected block.  A detector recognizes this, successfully queries the
       decoder for its address, and reports that information on the OpenLCB bus. That information results
       in a speed command such as Slow or Stop being sent to that particular train.

   There is a simpler use case for detectors without the ability to read the address:

   A signal needs to determine occupancy in the block it protects. It is not concerned with identity, but
   it does need to know location and entry/exit.

   This can be handled efficiently with standard PCER messages carrying just the EventID.

    1. A train enters a current-detected block. A detector recognizes this, and attempts unsuccessfully to
       query the decoder for its address.  The detector emits a report without decoder address information.

    2. A train exits a current-detected block. A detector recognizes this, and reports that interaction on
       the OpenLCB bus.

    3. A train crosses an RFID reader which determines the train’s DCC address and reports that address on
       the OpenLCB bus.

    4. A train-announcement unit needs to determine the identity and location of approaching trains so it
       can announce their arrival.

    5. A train display needs to gather all train locations for display to the users.

    6. A train display needs to gather the location and identity of all trains within a specified area.

    7. An application needs to gather the location and identity of all trains.

    8. A node powers up and emits a query which generates messages carrying all available location
       information.

    9. An RFID reader reads a tag and uses this protocol to distribute the raw tag contents.  A separate
       database node receives this content, does an internal lookup to locate the rolling stock’s Unique
       ID, and then uses this protocol to distribute a human-readable version of the original distribution
       that also carries the rolling stock’s Unique ID.

   10. A detector observes that a piece of rolling stock has been added to the layout.  It reports this. A
       throttle or command station provides that rolling stock in its roster display.

   11. A detector observes that a piece of rolling stock has been removed from the layout. A throttle or
       command station removes that rolling stock from its roster display.

   12. The user has a throttle, which has a train on it. There is a location report coming in for that
       train. The user would like to display on the throttle the name of the location where that train was
       seen. (This has to be a user-visible name, so coming out of some configuration.)  This raises two
       indirection issues that need to be solvable:

         1. Indirection of the OpenLCB train and the detector address. Say this is a DCC train from a
            command station, then there is a known DCC address, which is recognized by RailCom detectors,
            and reported. The harder case of OpenLCB trains needs to be handled too.

         2. Indirection from the detector address to a user-visible (configured) block name.

   13. Cab signaling: display on the throttle what the next signal aspect is for the selected train. This
       raises indirection issues:

         1. Going from train to block as above

         2. Going from physical orientation plus reverser setting on the logical locomotive to an absolute
            direction inside the block

         3. Going from block + absolute direction to a next signal (which is a multi-state state machine)

         4. Aspect interpretation (state to human readable text)

1.2 Unserved Use Cases

   (To be determined as the proposal is developed)

1.3 Requirements

    1. The protocol should cover multiple hardware types, including RFID and QR scanners, RailCom and other
       DCC detectors, and follow-on hardware that can detect and identify rolling stock at a point, on a
       track section, or in an area.

    2. To the extent possible, the protocol should identify standard forms for common information.  

         1. The Unique ID of the identified rolling stock should be in a common location in the protocol’s
            message(s) so that it can be extracted regardless of the form of the sensor that generated it:
            a RFID detector and a QR detector on the same layout should both provide the same information
            on the identity of the detected rolling stock.

         2. The Unique ID of the scanner should be in a common location in the protocol’s message(s) so
            that it can be extracted regardless of the form of the sensor that generated it.

    3. To the extent possible, the protocol should identify methods for its message(s) to carry
       detector-specific information.  For example, a RFID detector and a QR detector on the same layout
       should both be able to publish their tag-specific information.

    4. The identification of the scanning hardware should be guaranteed unique.  This lets hardware be
       added to a layout without having to resolve conflicts.

    5. The messages should not rely on the transmitting-node-address field of the message for decoding.
        I.e. the protocol doesn’t say “You identify who made the scan by looking at who sent the message”.
        This allows replacing the physical hardware that is broken with another piece of physical hardware
       carrying the same configuration; we expect that the entire network continues to operate as it did
       before. It is also useful to allow messages to be created by e.g. a debugging node during
       development.

    6. It should be possible to look at the message(s) carrying a specific scan and know that they contain
       a scan without additional information.  I.e. you don’t have to configure a layout monitor with all
       possible scanner IDs before it can start processing or displaying scanning results.

    7. The identification of which scanner is reporting should be early in the message(s).  This allows
       nodes to drop the receipt of the message(s) early, without having to buffer them completely.

    8. The identification of the detected rolling stock should be early in the message(s).  This allows
       nodes to drop the receipt of the message(s) early, without having to buffer them completely.

    9. There should be a standard algorithm to find the UniqueID of the scanned piece of rolling stock
       within the message(s), when the scanner can provide one.  In the common case of DCC, this is the
       UniqueID mapped from the DCC address. For some scanners, e.g some types of RFID scanner, the scanner
       might not be able to map the scanned value to a specific piece of rolling stock, in which case this
       information field would be blank.  

   10. Note that the item directly above is referring to a full Unique ID (node ID), not just a DCC
       address. Someday, there will be LCC-native trains and this protocol should be ready for them.  The
       alternative is inevitably a messy migration at some point in the future.

   11. Ideally, information about short circuit and current overload status could be conveyed by this
       protocol. These are often generated by the same device as the transponder messages e.g. LocoNet
       devices. These are providing location-specific information. It would be good to have some
       commonality between all location based messages. Another example would be current or voltage
       measurements at a point.  

1.4 Not Requirements; Unmet Requirements

    1. The messages for this protocol should be a super-set of those from the DCC Detection Protocol.

                                             2 Specified Sections

   This is the usual section organization for a Technical Note, to accumulate the Standard and Technical
   Note content in its eventual order.

   In this section, deeply indented content is intended for the eventual Technical Note.

2.1 Introduction

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

   A “scanner’ is a device that can gather information from the railroad, typically when something happens.
   RFID readers, QR code readers, point optical detectors and track current detectors are all examples of
   scanners. There may be many scanners associated with an individual node.

   A scanner forwards one instance of the gathered information as a “report”.

2.2 Intended Use

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

   This protocol is intended to provide a standardized way for scanners to distribute report information
   across the OpenLCB network.

2.3 Reference and Context

   See also the DCC Detection working note for a simpler form specific to DCC.

   This working note assumes adoption of the Event With Payload working note as a Standard.

2.4 Message Formats

  2.4.1 Report Message

   The proposal is to carry reports within a Producer Consumer Event Report (PCER) as an event with payload
   defined by:

   Note bytes 0-7 are the Event ID of the message, 8 through the end of the message are the payload of the
   message.

     * Bytes 0-1: The defined prefix 0x0102 is assigned to this.

   This unambiguously identifies this PCER message as part of this protocol.

   That enables nodes not interested in this protocol to discard this event-with-payload transmission
   immediately.

   Using a unique prefix followed by a UniqueID (see immediately below) is a mechanism for creating a
   fully-unique Event ID. No other Event ID allocation mechanism can duplicate one of these IDs.

   As an alternative, using multiple prefixes to separate out various forms of content was considered.
    This makes the interactions below more complicated, without any particular benefit, so a single prefix
   is used.

     * Bytes 2-7: A Unique ID that specifies the device that read the information e.g. a scanner.

   Having this in the 1st eight bytes, i.e. the Event ID, allows using the various identify message
   exchanges to locate scanners.

   Putting this near the start of the message (1st CAN frame) allows early rejection of uninteresting
   scanner sources.

   Note that each scanner has a Unique ID that may be separate from the Unique ID of the node supporting
   it.  In the case of multiple scanners associated with a node, each will have its own Unique ID, and only
   one at most may be the same as that node.

     * Bytes 8-9: Flag bits, defined below

     * Bytes 10-15: A Unique ID that specifies the item being scanned, e.g. a train node ID, DCC address
       mapped to a Unique ID, or zeros if the information is not available.

   This will fit in the 2nd CAN frame, allowing early rejection of uninteresting items when available.

   Placing this in the content and having the scanner ID in the first eight bytes was preferred because it
   simplified the defined interactions.

   The process for mapping a DCC address to a Unique ID is defined elsewhere.

     * Bytes 16-NN: Any read (scanned) content that's available.

   Note that there is no restriction on the length of the message in the Standard.  When designing
   something using this protocol, it’s important to consider the impact of the data length on network
   bandwidth and latency, particularly in light of the section on “Retrieving most recent scan reports”
   below.

    2.4.1.1 Flag bits

   bits 0-1: entry/exit

   0b00: unknown – This message may or may not be due to an item appearing or disappearing.

   E.g. this might refer to an item that’s remaining within the scanned region.

    

   0b01: entry without state – The report refers to an item appearing in the detected area; no report of
   the item eventually disappearing from the detected area will follow.

   0b10: entry with state – The report refers to an item appearing in the detected area; a report of the
   item eventually disappearing from the detected area will follow.

   0b11: exit – The report refers to an item disappearing from the detected area.

    

    

   bits 2-3: direction of relative motion – Defined with respect to the designated front of the piece of
   rolling stock.

    

   0b00: unknown

   0b01: forward

   0b10: reverse

   0b11: stopped

    

   bits 4-5: direction of absolute motion – The geographical meanings of these are defined during set up of
   the scanner. Note that this is the direction of motion, not direction the front of the item is pointing.

    

   0b00: unknown

   0b01: east/north

   0b10: west/south

    

   0b11: stopped

   bits 6-7:  facing direction – The geographical direction that the front of the item is facing. The
   geographical meanings of these are defined during the set up of the scanners.

    

   0b00: unknown – The scanner did not determine a value for this item.

    There could be scanners that can detect this but can’t detect forward/reverse motion and east/west
   motion.

   0b01: east/north

   0b10: west/south

   0b11: reserved – Do not send, ignore on receipt.

   bits 8-9: flags content that spans multiple EWP messages

   0b00 – only EWP message of the content

   0b01 – first EWP message of the content, will be followed by more EWP messages

   0b11 – middle EWP message of the content, will be followed by more EWP messages

   0b10 – last EWP message of the content, must be preceded by an EWP marked “first EWP”.

   It is strongly recommended that nodes sending Location Services define their content to be as short as
   possible, such that multiple-EWP messages are not necessary.  For example, nodes should not repeat
   previous Location Services message content when they send an additional Location Services message with
   additional content.  A node that’s adding human-readable information to a prior Location Services report
   that already contains several optional fields, e.g. position information, should not repeat those
   optional fields.

   Nodes that are expecting several types of optional Location Services information for a single reporting
   event should expect that information to arrive in multiple Location Services messages.

   bits 10-11: reserved, send as zero and ignore on receipt

   bits 12-15: content format – see below

   The content format field is used to indicate the format of bytes 16-NN

   00x0 reserved, do not send; ignore message upon receipt

   0x1 (initial) standard content form, see below

    2.4.1.2 Standard Content Form

   The standard content form consists of one or more blocks formatted as

   byte 0: length of content N, including type byte and data but not including the length byte. The value
   of 0xFF is reserved for expansion to longer blocks and should not be used until that is defined.

   Numerology:   Although the length of EWP messages is limited to to a total of 256 bytes, it is possible
   for the Location Services content to be longer than that through the use of the first/middle/last
   flags.Messages with over 256 bytes of content in a single block are expected to be rare and are strongly
   recommended against at this time.  Should that be required at some point, that data can be placed in
   multiple blocks defined with their own first, middle, end flags, or a system for identifying longer
   blocks can be defined. There is not enough information available to define this method at this time,
   although not doing so will result is some backward-compatibility issues,

   byte 1: type of content – see below

   byte 2-N: content defined by type byte

   There can be more than one block, in which case the blocks are concatenated with no intervening bytes.
   Blocks of length 0 (i.e. a single zero byte) can optionally appear at the end of the message.

    2.4.1.3 Standard Content Block Types

   The type-byte values are allocated by this document.  It’s expected that new types will be routinely
   added.  The current set of types are:

   0: Reserved, do not send, ignore the associated block on receipt

   This is meant as a convenient flag for software while creating and parsing messages.

   1: Human-readable format. Not intended for machine parsing, this is meant to carry messages for human
   display.

   An example would be “Train 123 arriving at station ABC”.

   2: Raw content of a read RFID tag

   In the  future, it may be desirable to define types for specific types of tag, e.g. ISO14443, ISO15693,
   etc. That’s left for a future version once more usage experience is available.

   3: Raw content of a QR or bar code read

   4: Raw content of a RailCom read

   Is there a document we can refer to about the format and content of this?

   The scanner is expected to parse the contents of the read data and fill in as many of the flag fields as
   possible.

   5: Raw content of a Digitrax Transponding read

   Is there a document we can refer to about the format and content of this?

   The scanner is expected to parse the contents of the read data and fill in as many of the flag fields as
   possible.

   6: Position information: Three 16-bit IEEE floating point numbers representing the X, Y and Z position
   of the detected object on the layout. The units are meters.  

   The origin and direction of axes is specified when the scanner is configured by the user, but
   conventionally X is -left/+right, Y is -front/+back and Z is -down/+up from some location on the layout.
   This corresponds to putting the origin at the left-front of the layout on the lowest level.

   Note that 8-bit IEEE does not have a suitable resolution at a suitable maximum range. 16-bit IEEE
   provides roughly 16mm steps at +/-25m

   7. DCC address: Two byte short or long DCC address, defined with the leading 0xC000 for long addresses.

   8. Set speed:  Float16 value of the current set speed; NaN if not available

   9. Commanded speed:  Float16 value of the current commanded speed; NaN if not available

   10. Actual speed: Float16 value of the current actual speed; NaN if not available

    

   11: Analog information: For reporting analog information (voltage, current, temperature, water level, …)
   as an IEEE-16 value in SI units, followed by a byte for units, followed by an optional human-readable
   string. The defined units are

   0: Unknown, no unit specified.

   1: Volts

   2: Amperes

   3: Watts

   4: Ohms

   5: Degrees C

   6: Seconds

   7: Meters

   8: Meters2

   9: Meters3

   10: Meters/second

   11: Meters/second/second

   12: Kilograms

   13: Newtons

   All others: Reserved, do not send, treat as unknown on receipt

   There needs to be something in the block so that there can be multiple independent analog information
   readings in the block. Note that there can be multiple readings of a single type in the same message
   e.g. “Ambient temperature” and “Motor temperature”.

   All others reserved, do not send; ignore the block on receipt.

   Definitions for JSON and XML formats were considered. They were not included because that would define
   yet another level of syntax that would require standardization, and it was felt that the standard format
   could be defined to carry the same data as needed.

  2.4.2 Consumed and Produced Event ID

   Every node that produces information via this protocol must also consume a specific well-known Event ID
   consisting of the well-known 0x0102 prefix assigned  followed by six 0x00 bytes. When asked to Identify
   Producers for this event, the reply should include the Valid modifier because the consuming nodes are
   always prepared to respond to this event.

   The six 0x00 bytes is an invalid Unique ID, so no scanner will allocate this as its own.

   Nodes that will inquire for the current values of reports produce a specific well-known Event ID
   consisting of the 0x0102 prefix followed by six 0x00 bytes. When asked to Identify Producers for this
   event, the reply should include the Unknown modifier because there’s no state associated with this
   inside the producer.

2.5 States

   This protocol has no states.

   Remembering that a report for entry to a detected area has been sent, so that an exit message can later
   be sent, is not considered a public state of the protocol.

2.6 Interactions

   Note that the Unique ID that specified the scanner doing the reading (bytes 2-7) does not need to be the
   Node ID of the scanning node.  It just needs to be uniquely assigned by the node creator from some
   assigned space to indicate the device doing the read.

   For example, consider a board that supports four RFID readers that operate independently.  Each of those
   readers will have a distinct Unique ID that is used when its detections are reported. In addition, the
   board will have a single Unique ID that it uses as its node ID.  This may, but does not have to be, the
   same as the Unique ID of one of the readers.

   When requested to Identify Producers for one of the Report Messages defined above, the Producer
   Identified response should  carry as modifiers:

     * Valid – the last Report Message’s contents are still valid, and would be produced now

     * Invalid – the last Report Message’s contents are no long valid, and would not be produced now

     * Unknown – if neither of the above apply

   These values are chosen to be consistent with the general definitions in the Event Transport protocol
   definition.

  2.6.1 Reporting new information

   When a scanner gathers new information, it may emit a PCER message with the above format.  PCER messages
   are global, so all interested nodes will receive this message. The interested nodes can then process
   them as desired.

   Note this says “may emit”.  That choice of whether or not to report every time new information is
   received is up to the device manufacturer.

   Note that a single node implementing multiple readers will send PCER event-with-payload messages from
   those separate readers but must not interleave the messages making up the payload of those separate PCER
   messages.  The event with payload protocol requires that the sending node only sends one PCER
   event-with-payload sequence at a time.  

   Example: An RFID reader reads the fixed information from a tag.  This does not directly contain a Unique
   ID for the scanned item.  The reader produces a report with a zero value for bytes 10-15, the identity
   of the scanned item, and a block of RFID information.  A second node with a RFID → Node ID mapping
   database consumes that message, looks up the appropriate Unique ID of the scanned item, and produces a
   report message that contains it and the original RFID information block.

   Example: A scanner produces a message that carries only the minimal information.  A second node with
   other sources of data consumes that message. Using the Unique IDs for the scanner and the scanned item,
   this second node creates suitable human-readable content such as “Train 123 arriving on track 4 five
   minutes late”. It then adds that content as a new block and produces a new message with otherwise the
   same content.  Meanwhile, a third node driving a station display consumes the first message, sees it’s
   from its associated scanner but there’s no human readable content and discards it.  It then consumes the
   second message, sees it’s from its appropriate scanner and contains a human-readable block, extracts the
   human readable content, and displays it.

   Example: A control node is tasked with controlling the speed of each train that approaches a signal. A
   scanner is configured to report the arrival and departure of each train on the track approaching the
   signal, including Unique ID and directional information.  The control node recognizes reports from that
   scanner, extracts the train’s unique ID, and determines whether the train is approaching the signal or
   receding from it.  The control node then has enough information to control the train via the traction
   protocol.

   Example: A node facilitating cab signaling will consume all messages from this protocol. It consumes all
   reports reporting arrival of all trains on the track approaching each signal. For each report, it
   determines if the train is approaching the signal, (somehow) determines the current aspect of the
   relevant signal, and then transmits that aspect to the relevant train throttle(s) using some protocol
   not defined here.  

   This could also be done on the throttle by checking for its own scanned ID in reports, but that requires
   substantial context information that seems better centralized.

   Or there could be a mechanism for directly inquiring about the current aspect of the signal associated
   with a particular reader’s Unique ID, which would allow a distributed mechanism.

   Example: A video system is directly tracking trains.  For each train, it periodically produces a report
   that contains the X, Y, Z position of the train.  Each of these comes from the same scanner ID, the
   Unique ID associated with the video system.  For this to work with a signal system from another vendor,
   a node is provided that can compute occupancy in virtual blocks: When the train is inside a specific
   volume, that’s considered to be occupancy in a specific virtual block associated with a specific virtual
   scanner’s Unique ID.  Upon finding a train in one of these, this node will produce a report that
   includes the Unique ID of the specific virtual scanner. This in turn will be consumed in the usual way
   by the signal system node(s) that are looking for occupancy on that associated section of track.

  2.6.2 Identification of scanners

    Sending the defined 0x01 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 Event ID in an Identify Consumer message will result in
   Consumer Identified messages that indicate which nodes can take part in this protocol.

   This removes the need to include this protocol in the Protocol Identification Protocol bits, although
   that can also be considered for ease of access.

   Note that this refers to nodes. The individual scanners are not nodes. They’re not expected to each
   implement the full OpenLCB protocol stack.  Instead, this protocol has a single node providing that
   service for multiple scanners.

   Once the nodes that use this protocol have been identified, an Identify Events directed to each of them
   will return Producer Identified messages indicating the Unique IDs of all the scanners.

  2.6.3 Identification of scannable objects

   There is currently no way to efficiently request the unique IDs of all scannable objects. Some of them
   might not be currently visible to the system. You can retrieve all presently-visible objects by
   retrieving the most recent scan reports, see section below.

  2.6.4 Retrieving most recent scan reports

   When a new node joins the network, it may want to catch up on previous scan reports. In that case, the
   new node can produce (in a PCER message) the 0x01 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 Event ID.  This is consumed by
   all nodes that implement this protocol.  When consumed, each of those nodes will re-emit the most recent
   report from each of its scanner implementations.

   How to handle multiple overlapping reports from the same scanner?  Just send them all? In what order?
   Option for the implementor?

   This might be a large load on the network. PCER messages are high priority, and this request will result
   on one or more messages from (most? all?) scanners.

   There is no standard interaction defined to get a report from just one scanned device, i.e. there is no
   standard interaction defined that does “Any scanner that currently sees device A.B.C.D.E.F, please
   resend your last report”.

  2.6.5 Identifying users of scanned information

   A node can identify  nodes that use scanned information by emitting an Identify Producer message for the
   0x01 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 Event Id.  

   The Standard doesn’t actually require that a using node be able to produce that event if it’s not going
   to inquire about the current reports.  So this is not “identify all nodes that use scanned information”.

  2.6.6 Traffic limiting

   Producing nodes may not produce the same event with payload content more than twice per second.

   The goal of this section is to reduce the bandwidth consumed by repeating detection messages.

   Another approach would have been to prohibit sending the same content twice in a row. However, there may
   be situations where that’s a valid thing to do.

                                           3 Background Information

   RFID readers and tags come in multiple forms. With 13.56MHz RFID, be it ISO14443 (as used in the RC522
   readers), or ISO15693 as used in StaRFIshrail, the following points apply:

     * Up to 8 bytes can be read "on the fly", i.e. as the tag on a train passes over a reader at speed.
        Depending on how the reader is set up, these 8 bytes can either be the UID of the tag, programmed
       in at time of manufacture, or 8 bytes of EPROM, which can be programmed into the tag by the user.
        The usage of these 8 bytes would be determined by the user, but could, say, be 2 bytes for Stock
       ID, 2 bytes for DCC address, and 4 bytes for other purposes.

     * In addition, there at least another 96 bytes of user programmable EPROM, but these need to be read
       when the tag is essentially static over a reader, due to the time taken to read all the bytes.

   The tags used by the MERG CAN RFID readers provide five bytes of programmable payload. Multiple
   conventions have been proposed for the contents of those bytes.

   QR codes come in multiple forms.  Depending on version, size and error correction level, they can
   contain thousands of characters, many more than can reasonably be carried across OpenLCB CAN links.

   Some scanners can report the direction of the detected train. For some, this is whether the train is
   moving in forward or reverse.  For others, it’s whether the train is moving in one direction on the
   track vs the other (North vs South, East vs West), e.g. ProTrak Grapevine systems can report moving
   North/East, not moving, and moving South/West.

   RPS detectors reported absolute X, Y and Z coordinates of the detected rolling stock.  The report was
   emitted at specified intervals.  Although these are no longer being produced, something similar may
   emerge in the future with developments in e.g. video monitoring of a layout.

   Traditional block detectors and point detectors are an interesting special case. They’re simple,
   low-cost and common on layouts. They can’t sense any address information from the detected rolling
   stock. Although their needs are already met by the Event Transfer protocol itself, they can also use
   this  protocol to convey their information too.
