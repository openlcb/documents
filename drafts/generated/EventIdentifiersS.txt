                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This standard describes the format and allocation of OpenLCB Event Identifiers (Event IDs). It is not
   specific to any wire protocol.

                                         2 Intended use (Informative)

   This standard defines the format and allocation of Event Identifiers.  Event Identifiers are typically
   used with the Event Transport protocol and are globally unique.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   This Standard is in the context of the following OpenLCB Standards:

     * The CAN Physical Layer Standard, which specifies the physical layer for transporting OpenLCB-CAN
       frames

     * The Message Network Standard, which defines the basic messages and how they interact. Higher-level
       protocols are based on this message network, but are defined elsewhere.

     * The Event Transport Standard, which defines the protocol for transporting events.

     * The Unique Identifiers Standard which defines the format and allocation of unique 48-bit
       identifiers.

                                             4 Format (Normative)

   An OpenLCB event identifier shall be eight bytes of eight bits each.  Except as specifically noted
   within this document, the upper 6-bytes are represented by a uniquely assigned Node ID.

   The order of bytes in an OpenLCB Event Identifier shall be considered significant. The most-significant
   byte shall be transmitted first during communication operations. The most-significant byte shall be
   written first (left-most in Western format) in any human-readable representation.  Within the tables
   below, byte 1 is considered the most-significant byte, while byte 8 is considered the least significant
   byte.

                                           5 Allocation (Normative)
