                                                1 Introduction

   This Standard contains normative information about the OpenLCB Message Network. Corresponding discussion
   and background can be found in the corresponding OpenLCB Message Network Technical Note.

   The protocol is described via three components: the state machine within the node(s); the messages; and
   the basic interactions in which the nodes take part. These are separately described below in terms of
   the general format as well as specific message definitions.

   Messages are transported across a specific data-link level implementation, for example using CAN frames,
   TCP/IP sockets, or other transports.  The messages are described first in general terms, then mapped to
   specific implementations (see Sections 8 and beyond).  The states and interactions are the same across
   all data-link implementations.

                                                2 Intended Use

   The messages and interactions described here are used by all OpenLCB nodes to connect to the OpenLCB
   network.   They are mandatory.

3.1 Message Format

   OpenLCB messages are sent using the transfer mechanism and format described in the Standard for a
   specific wire protocol.

   All messages shall contain a source Node ID and a Message Type Indicator (MTI).  The MTI defines both
   the general format of the message and its specific type.  All messages with the same MTI are of the same
   type.

  3.1.1 Message Type Indicators

   The general Message Type Indicator (MTI) is a 16-bit quantity. The MTI values are remapped for specific
   wire protocols, see the appropriate sections of this document for adaptation to CAN and TCP/IP.  

   The current allocations are documented in a separate spreadsheet1. We keep them in just that one place
   to avoid conflicting updates. Those allocations are normative.

   Note that these fields inform the intent of the message, but also the overall format of the rest of the
   message.  

    

  3.1.2 Message Content

   The message content consists of:

     * The MTI

     * The source Node ID

     * If the MTI flags it as being present, the destination Node ID

     * If the MTI flags it as being present, an Event ID

     * Any other content as defined for the specific message type.   

   The exact format and order are defined by the specific wire protocols, but in all cases the message
   shall be fully decodable based on the flag-bit information in the MTI.  

3.2 States

   The message network layer in an OpenLCB node has two states:

     * Uninitialized

     * Initialized

   Nodes shall start in the Uninitialized state.

   A node in the Uninitialized state may transmit an Initialization Complete message, but shall not
   transmit any other message type.

   A node in the Initialized state may transmit any message type.

    

3.3 Definition of Specific Messages

   This section defines the format of common core messages. Although there is a short description of the
   purpose of the message, and related interactions, this is just for identification and explanatory
   purposes. The meaning of the messages is defined by the interactions in which they take part.  These are
   described in later sections.

   When a Node ID is present in the data content of the message, the full 48-bit identifier shall be sent
   for all wire protocols, specifically including CAN, even if an alias or alternate form is available
   elsewhere in the message.  

  3.3.1 Initialization Complete

   Indicates that the sending-node initialization is complete and, once the message is delivered, it is
   reachable on the network.  

   Name                    Description            Simple Protocol Dest ID Event ID CommonMTI Data Content

   This message has two MTIs, distinguished by the modifier field, to indicate whether the node requires
   delivery of all the messages in the full protocol, or whether delivery of the Simple Protocol subset is
   sufficient.

  3.3.2 Verify Node ID

   Issued to determine which node(s) are present and can be reached.

   This message has two MTIs, distinguished by the modifier field, to indicate whether the node requires
   delivery of all the messages in the full protocol, or whether delivery of the Simple Protocol subset is
   sufficient.

   protocol but it is not required for conformance

3.4 Interactions

   All nodes shall be able to take part in all standard interactions, as defined below.

  3.4.1 Node Initialization

   Newly functional nodes, once their start-up is complete and they are fully operational, shall send an
   Initialization Complete message and enter the Initialized state.  Nodes shall not emit any other OpenLCB
   message before the Initialization Complete message.

  3.4.2 Node ID Detection

   Upon receipt of a directed (addressed) Verify Node ID message addressed to it, a node shall reply with
   an unaddressed Verified Node ID message.    

   Upon receipt of a global (unaddressed) Verify Node ID message that does not contain an (optional) Node
   ID, a node shall reply with an unaddressed Verified Node ID message.

   Upon receipt of a global (unaddressed) Verify Node ID message that contains an (optional) Node ID, a
   node will reply with an unaddressed Verified Node ID message, if and only if the receiving node's Node
   ID matches the one received.

   If a node receives multiple Verify Node ID messages before it replies to one or more, it may, but is not
   required to, combine multiple responses into one.

  3.4.3 Protocol Support Inquiry and Response

   On receipt of a Protocol Support Inquiry message, a node will reply with a Protocol Support  Response
   with bit values corresponding to the protocols that the node implements.  

    

3.5 Error Handling

   There are multiple error-handling scenarios defined.  

  3.5.1 Reject Addressed Optional Interaction

   If a Node receives an addressed message with an MTI that is not part of the mandatory set, and it does
   not want to take part in that interaction, it shall send an Optional-Interaction Rejected (OIR) message
   addressed to the originating node, with the original MTI in the message content to indicate that the MTI
   is not recognized or not implemented by this node.   The OIR message content may also contain a reason
   code and a data value, as defined by the protocol, as listed below in section 3.5.6.  

  3.5.2 Reject Unaddressed Optional Interaction

   If a Node receives an unaddressed message with an MTI that indicates the start of a non-mandatory /
   optional interaction, and the Node does not take part in that optional interaction, it may silently drop
   the message without reply.

  3.5.3 Reject Addressed Standard Interaction Due to Error

   If a Node is taking part in an addressed interaction with another node, where either node may be able to
   send the next message, and some error condition prevents this Node from continuing the interaction, to
   terminate the interaction, this Node shall send a Terminate Due to Error message to the other Node. It
   shall reset its state so as to no longer be taking part in the addressed interaction.  The message
   content shall contain the most recent MTI received in this interaction, a mandatory reason code and an
   optional data value.

   In addition, upon receipt of the Terminate Due to Error message, the other Node also shall reset its
   state so as to no longer be taking part in the addressed interaction.

  3.5.4 Duplicate Node ID Discovery

   OpenLCB nodes shall indicate an error when they detect an incoming message with a Source Node ID equal
   to their own using whatever indication technology is available.  See the General Event documentation for
   one method of indication that uses a well-known Global-Event.  

    

  3.5.5 Error codes

   Numerous messages are defined to carry status information and error codes. An OpenLCB Error code is a
   2-byte value of the following format:

    

   Error Code Format
   Bits  Description                                                                                        
   12-15 Error type flags.  Zero or one bit shall be selected.                                              
   8-11  Reserved.  Send as zero, ignored on receipt.                                                       
   4-7   General Error Enumeration 0-15.  Default as zero, and ignored on receipt.                          
         Reserved for use of specific protocols for error reporting.  Interpretation of these bits will be  
   0-3   defined in the specific protocol documentation.  A value of zero in this field means no further    
         information is available.  Default as 0, and ignored on receipt.                                   

    

    

   The following General Error Codes are defined. All protocols shall use at least Error Codes 0x0000,

3.6 Routing

   All messages may be, but are not required to be, presented to every node for processing.  

   Addressed messages shall to be routed to the addressed node. The node transmitting an addressed message
   addressed to itself shall take part in any interactions required by the message.  

   Unless otherwise specified in a protocol document, global messages shall be forwarded to all nodes.  The
   node transmitting a global message shall take part in any interactions required by the message.  

3.7 Delays and Timeouts

   Nodes shall send messages required by OpenLCB protocols within 750 milliseconds, unless otherwise
   indicated in the documentation for the specific protocol interaction.

   Nodes may, but are not required to, use a timeout mechanism to protect against messages lost due to
   malfunctions.  Such a timeout shall not be shorter than 3 seconds.

                                        4 Simple Node Protocol Subset

   OpenLCB uses the Simple Node Protocol to distinguish a subset of global message types that are never
   needed by certain “simple” nodes. They can then be rapidly ignored by those nodes, and gateways can
   filter them from segments that contain only simple nodes, etc.  It is not normative.  

4.1 Protocol Description

   Operationally, the simple node protocol is defined by the MTIs that carry a set Simple Node bit, plus
   all addressed messages. This section summarize received transmitted messages.  

  4.1.1 Messages Transmitted

   Simple nodes may transmit any message, which shall be propagated normally.   

  4.1.2 Messages Received

   Simple nodes shall receive any message specifically addressed to them, plus the following unaddressed
   global messages:

     * Verify Node ID ;

     * Verified Node ID;

     * Protocol Support Inquiry;

     * Identify Consumers;

     * Identify Producers;

     * Identify Events;

     * Learn Event;

     * P/C Event Report;

   In the future, additional MTIs will be defined. If simple nodes need to received them, the MTI will
   indicate that via the Simple bit – see previous section.

  4.1.3 Messages Not Received

   Messages not listed in the section above do not need to be received by simple nodes.

  4.1.4 Messages Directed at Gateways

   Gateways need to know which nodes consider themselves to be Simple.  These nodes shall use the variants
   of the Initialization Complete and Verified Node ID messages that indicate Simple Set Sufficient (0x0101
   and 0x0171, respectively) to indicate to Gateways that they are simple nodes.

                                              7 CAN Adaptations

7.1 Introduction

   This section specifies how the Common Protocols are mapped to the CAN.  While CAN is relatively
   inexpensive and robust, it is limited by its bandwidth and its total frame size, which is about
   12-bytes, and by its speed (125 kbps).  Each CAN frame includes a header (29-bits) and a data-part
   (8-bytes).  In addition, the CAN-header has special properties which both enhance and limit its use.
    The Common Messages are adapted to CAN by:

     * The Common-MTI is shortened to 12 bits, and carried in the header.  

     * Node IDs are shortened to 12 bit CAN-Aliases.  

     * Longer messages are fragmented into one or more CAN-frames.  Special frames formats are used to
       implement Datagrams and Streams.  

   These mappings result in a set of modified formats as documented in this section.  This section's
   numbering parallels that of the Common sections.  

    

   Common Message CAN Mapping                     Comment                                                   
   Most messages  Usually single frame            Multiple frames are used for longer messages.             
   Datagram       First-, Middle-,…, Last- frames Small Datagrams may be carried by a single Only-frames.   
   Stream         Stream-Data-frames              A common Stream-message will be mapped to one or more     
                                                  Stream-Data-frames.                                       

    

7.2 Intended Use

   CAN is intended as a local transport for smaller layouts, or for local segments on larger layouts.
    Accommodation and specialization is necessary to implement the protocols onto CAN because CAN frames
   are limited to about 12 bytes of information.   The main mappings include a shortened CAN-MTI (12-bits)
   and the use of 12 bit aliases for Node Ids.  These have implications for Gateways which are specified
   below.  

  7.2.1 References and Context

   This Standard is in the context of the following OpenLCB CAN Standards:

     * The OpenLCB CAN Frame Transfer Standard, which specifies transfer of OpenLCB messages over CAN
       segments. “CAN” refers to the electrical and protocol specifications as defined in ISO 11898-1:2003
       and ISO 11898-2:2003 and their successors.

7.3 Messages

  7.3.1 Message Format

   The CAN mapping uses several formats.  The general form of the CAN header is:

   29-bit CAN Header
   Field             CAN prefix    Frame Format   Variable Field                    Source ID

   CAN frames also contain other bit fields not detailed here, including a DLC or length field.  

    7.3.1.1 CAN Prefix Field

   The CAN Prefix Field contains control bits specific to CAN.  

    7.3.1.2 CAN MTI Mapping

   The Common MTI is mapped to one of eight frame formats:

   Frame Format Meaning                    
   0            (Reserved)

   4            Datagram middle frame      
   5            Datagram final frame       
   6            (Reserved)                 
   7            Stream Data                

   Table 2: CAN Frame Format Values

    7.3.1.3 Global and Addressed Messages, CAN Frame Format 1

   Global and Addressed messages are those Common MTIs with the “stream and datagram” bits set to 0, and
   are mapped to and from CAN MTI format 1.

   The CAN MTI is carried in the CAN header.  It consists of the lowest-order 12 bits of the Common MTI,
   and, by implication has the “stream or datagram” and “special” bits as zeros.

   Table 3: CAN Frame Format 1

   If the Address Present bit is set to 1, then the destination address is placed in the 1st two bytes of
   the data part of the CAN frame: the top nibble of the 1st byte contains flags (see below); the lower
   nibble of the 1st byte and the entire 2nd byte contain the 12-bit destination alias.  

   The format of this in binary is: 0brrff dddd, dddd dddd (or in hex: 0xfddd)
   where:

     * The two rr bits are reserved, and read and send as zeros.  

     * The two ff bits can be used for packing and unpacking large messages to a sequence of CAN frames,
       see below.  The coding is:  

     * 00 Only frame

     * 01 First frame of more than one

     * 10 Last frame of more than one

     * 11 Middle frame of more than 2.

     * You can think of these as active-zero start and end bits, respectively.

   CAN frames marked as First or Middle frame shall carry eight total data bytes. CAN frames marked as Last
   or Only frame shall have from two through eight total data bytes.   

    7.3.1.4 Datagram and Stream Messages, CAN Frame Formats 2-5 and 7

   Frame Formats 2-5 and 7 are used specifically for Datagram and Stream messages.  

    

  7.3.2 States

   There are no special provisions for CAN transport layer.

   This shall be a multi-part message when there are more than 48 protocol-bits.  

  7.3.4 Extensibility

   Since the earlier nodes may reply as soon as they have processed only the data of which they are aware,
   their replies may be earlier than the last message fragment is received.  Sending-nodes shall be able to
   receive and process these replies as they are received.  

  7.3.5 Interactions

   There are no special provisions for CAN transport layer.

  7.3.6 Error Handling

   There are no special provisions for CAN transport layer.

  7.3.7 Routing and Sequencing

   CAN implementations shall send the frames of a message consecutively on the CAN bus, with no frames of
   equal or lower priority being interspersed. Higher-priority messages may be sent in the middle of a
   lower-priority message, including when the higher priority message itself is fragmented into multiple
   frames.

   Gateways shall reassemble the frames of fragmented messages before sending them out on data links that
   support the necessary message length, unless otherwise stated by a specific Standard.

   1 See the associated TN, which provides concrete examples that may help you understand the material in
   this document.

   2   Addressed messages are always directed to the destination node, regardless of the content of the
   Simple bit. See section 4

   3 For example, in this case, CAN delivers 12+1 bits of the MTI via each frame (the special bit is known
   to be zero).

   4 For example, in this case, CAN delivers 12+2 bits of the MTI via each frame (the special bit is known
   to be zero and the stream/datagram bit can be inferred).

   5  “fddd” refers to a flag-nibble  “f”, containing multipart flags, and the 12-bit Destination Node
   Alias “ddd”.  See TN.
