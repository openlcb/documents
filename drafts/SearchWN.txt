                                                     1 Introduction

   A Working Note is an intermediate step in the documentation process. It gathers together the content from various
   informal development documents, discussions, etc into a single place. One or more Working Notes form the basic for
   the next step, which is one or more Standard/TechNote pairs.

1.1 Served Use Cases

   Each OpenLCB node can be uniquely identified and addressed by its 48-bit Unique Identifier. However, often the
   48-bit identifier is unknown to the user, or at least inconvenient to determine. The search protocol will provide
   a means of node lookup by human readable string.

   The results of the search would be a set of nodes that match the search criteria.

   Though the idea would be to have a search protocol that can generically applied to different use cases, the use
   case that is front and center is the ability to find a train node for the purpose of bringing it under the control
   of a throttle.

   In a traditional DCC based system, a train is identified by its [typically unique] 2 or 4 digit number. In North
   American prototypes, this can typically be the cab number on the locomotive. However, in Europe, a 4 digit number
   is not large enough to represent the 6 digit cab numbers used by the prototypes there. As a result, many DCC
   systems already on the market today in Europe allow the user to associate additional metadata with the DCC address
   (like name, prototype model, road number, owner, etc...) and search a centralized database to find the appropriate
   DCC address associated with a given model.

   Given that OpenLCB extends the address space of train nodes much further beyond that of a DCC address, a search
   protocol is even more critical to the user being able to find the OpenLCB node representing a given model and
   bring it under control.

  1.1.1 Train Control Use Cases

   Find a node representing:

    1. a DCC 2 or 4 digit addressed

    2. a Marklin addressed

    3. Other legacy protocol address (DC, DCS, TMCC, RailCommand, etc...)

    4. User supplied metadata such as owner, road name, cab number, prototype model, etc...)

  1.1.2 Design options

   There are two design architectures currently under consideration. One of those architectures would require a
   centralized node that would index all the nodes that make up the search dataset and arbitrate responses based on a
   search query.

   The second architecture option is to distribute the search to all the nodes that make up the dataset individually,
   and make each node participating in the dataset to independently formulate a response.

    1.1.2.1 Centralized Index

   The concept of requiring a specialized node that is not a traditional control endpoint is somewhat counter to the
   spirit of OpenLCB. Though not strictly prohibited, OpenLCB is biased toward distributed, peer-to-peer,
   interactions rather than centralized master/slave interactions.

   The prime advantage of a centralized approach is that the responses can be throttled and provided in a
   predetermined order which is convenient for the user.

   A centralized solution can exist without the exclusion of a distributed solution, but for the moment, this option
   will remain off the table.

    1.1.2.2 Distributed Search

   The distributed approach requires that each node that is contained in the dataset take an individual look at its
   attributes and respond if it finds that it matches the search criteria. The challenge with this approach is that
   the node performing the search will not have any control of the order in which the results are returned. The
   solution to this is that the requesting node will need to put the results in order as they come in.

2.4 Message Formats

   In this section, we will look at some possibilities for the distributed search method.

  2.4.1 Query

   The search query should be a global message in order for each node^2. Currently the only global message format
   defined is an event and contains only 8 bytes of payload. Here is one proposal on how it might be formatted as an
   event payload:

    Byte 1  0x01 – Well-known                                                                      
    Byte 2  0x00 – Automatically routed                                                            
    Byte 3  0x00: search all capable nodes, 0x01: search all train nodes, 0x02-0xFF reserved       
    Byte 4  Flags:                                                                                 
                                                                                                   
            Bits 7..6:                                                                             
                                                                                                   
            0x0 = exact match, 0x01 = <string>*, 0x10 = *<string>, 0x11 = *<string>*               
                                                                                                   
            Bit 5: 1 = string response okay, 0 = datagram only                                     
                                                                                                   
            Bits 4..0 = bit mask of metadata fields to search                                      
    Byte 5  1 to 4 character search string, null terminated if less than 4 bytes. Additional wild  
    Byte 6  cards are denoted by the “*” character.                                                
    Byte 7  
    Byte 8  

   The main drawback of using an event is that the search criteria is bound to a very small number of characters. The
   search string size is further limited if UTF-8 encoding is used.

   An alternative would be to allow for a new kind of global message that can have more than 8 bytes of payload:

    Byte 1       0x01 – Well-known                                                                 
    Byte 2       0x00 – Automatically routed                                                       
    Byte 3       0x00: search all capable nodes, 0x01: search all train nodes, 0x02-0xFF reserved  
    Byte 4       Flags:                                                                            
                                                                                                   
                 Bits 7..6:                                                                        
                                                                                                   
                 0x0 = exact match, 0x01 = <string>*, 0x10 = *<string>, 0x11 = *<string>*          
                                                                                                   
                 Bit 5: 1 = string response okay, 0 = datagram only                                
                                                                                                   
                 Bits 4..0 = bit mask of metadata fields to search                                 
    Bytes 5 - 6  Max response size in bytes                                                        
    Bytes 7 - 8  Search sequence number. Increment by 1 with each successive search. Used for      
                 tying results back to individual query.                                           
    Bytes 9 -    Null terminated UTF-8 search string. Additional wild cards are denoted by the     
    254          “*” character.                                                                    

   Each node in the dataset receiving the global search message would perform an appropriate search of its own
   metadata fields and respond if it finds a match.

  2.4.2 Response

   Since the number of responses is theoretically unbounded, it is important that the the response traffic be
   relatively low priority. There are two possible forms the response could take:

    1. Node replies with its 48-bit Unique Identifier requiring further inquiry from the requesting node for the
       contents of various searched fields.

    2. Node replies with the contents of the searched fields as part of the reply

   Some attention should be paid to message priorities. Generally speaking, replies should have a higher priority
   than requests. If traditional events are used for the search query, this potentially presents a problem as the
   replies would then need to be the highest possible priority. Since search information is naturally lower priority
   than other control traffic, this presents a problem.

    2.4.2.1 Node ID Reply (option 1)

   This has the advantage of simplicity for the replying node. Furthermore, if the requesting node intends to sort
   the responses solely on the basis of of its 48-bit node ID, further inquiry of the search fields only need be
   completed for those nodes that are in the current viewable focus of the user. Further inquiry on the details of
   the node can be completed with the memory configuration protocol.

                Name               Dest ID    Simple Node     Common      CAN format            Data Content          
                                                                        
                                                                MTI     
    Node ID Search Reply              Y            Y          0xXXXX      0x19XX,Xsss       fddd, Sequence Number     

   One disadvantage is that if the requesting node wants to sort the responses by some criteria other than the Node
   ID, it must have at least enough storage to hold the Node ID of every single node that responds, at least until it
   can query the additional field(s) it wants to be the basis of its sorting. This is not necessarily a bound size as
   the dataset scales up to an indeterminate size.

    2.4.2.2 Reply with Content (option 2)

   This has the advantage of simplicity on the requesting node, without significantly increasing the complexity on
   the replying node. This could result in more flexibility on the field(s) used as the basis for sorting as well as
   the bind the memory required by the requesting node to handle the response.

            Name          Dest ID  Simple Node  Common  CAN format                    Data Content                    
                                                        
                                                 MTI    
    Node ID Search Reply     Y          Y       0xXXXX  0x19XX,Xsss  fddd, Sequence Number, list of null terminated   
                                                                       metadata field contents up to <max response    
                                                                                      size> bytes.                    

   One disadvantage is that more network bandwidth, perhaps significantly more, may be required for all the resulting
   nodes to respond. This may be acceptable as the network bandwidth should scale based on the number of nodes in it
   through additional segments, faster transport layers, etc...

2.5 States

2.6 Interactions

  2.6.1 Case Study, Bridge to Legacy DCC style throttle

   In this case, he legacy throttle request a 2/4 digit DCC address. The bridge makes an exact match search on the
   address. The DCC command station responds (as a proxy node) with the technology attribute set to “DCC”

   Note, other responses may also occur, but the bridge will ignore them unless the technology attribute is “DCC” and
   the address is an exact match.

   Bridge makes a map between the DCC address and 48-bit Unique Node ID of the proxy node. The Bridge competes the
   assignment with the legacy throttle.

  2.6.2 Case Study, Intermediate Throttle

   This throttle has a finite number of resources, but is native OpenLCB. Example hardware specs might includes.

    1. 32-bit MCU

    2. less than 1MB FLASH

    3. less than 256K RAM

    4. 4 line LCD screen (graphic or character)

    5. Numeric keypad + a few specially buttons

   Throttle wants to make a query *123* on a large dataset. The result is 50+ nodes. The throttle keeps a scroll list
   that is 10 entries and can display 4 at one time on the display. As the results come in, they go into the sorted
   list of 10 entries. Those entries that get pushed out of the list are forgotten by the throttle, they are out of
   focus of the display and the scroll buffer.

                            Out of focus up scroll buffer, empty when focused on top of list                          
                            Out of focus up scroll buffer, empty when focused on top of list                          
                            Out of focus up scroll buffer, empty when focused on top of list                          
                                                   In display focus 1                                                 
                                                   In display focus 2                                                 
                                                   In display focus 3                                                 
                                                   In display focus 4                                                 
                         Out of focus down scroll buffer, empty when focused on bottom of list                        
                         Out of focus down scroll buffer, empty when focused on bottom of list                        
                         Out of focus down scroll buffer, empty when focused on bottom of list                        

   When the throttle scrolls up in the list, it can immediately display the out of focus entries it has buffered. If
   this results in empty slots in the list, another search is kicked off in order to fill in the gap(s).
