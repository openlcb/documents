                                                     1 Introduction

   A Working Note is an intermediate step in the documentation process. It gathers together the content from various
   informal development documents, discussions, etc into a single place. One or more Working Notes form the basic for
   the next step, which is one or more Standard/TechNote pairs.

1.1 Served Use Cases

1.2 Unserved Use Cases

                                    2 Specified SectionsAnnotations to the Standard

   This is the usual section organization for a Technical Note, to accumulate the Standard and Technical Note content
   in its eventual order.

2.1 Introduction

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

2.2 Intended Use

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

  2.4.15 Get Configuration Options Reply

   To make it possible to make simple/cheap nodes, not every configuration operation & option needs to be provided.
   The reply to “Get Configuration Options” provides information that a configuring device can use to control how it
   communicates with the node so that it only uses available modes.

     * Available operations mask (2 bytes, bit coded): Indicate which operations are available so the using software
       can know whether convenience operations (which are not possible on some hardware) are available.

          * 0x8000 Write under mask supported

          * 0x4000 Unaligned reads supported. If not set, reads have to start on an address with the low bits, as
            given by the data size, all zero. For example a 4-byte write must have the low two address bits zero.

          * 0x2000 Unaligned writes supported. If not set, reads have to start on an address with the low bits, as
            given by the data size, all zero. For example a 4-byte write must have the low two address bits zero.

          * 0x0800 Read from address space 0xFC available (this is the manufacturer part of Abbreviated CDI)

          * 0x0400 Read from address space 0xFB available (this is the user-entered part of Abbreviated CDI)

          * 0x0200 Write to address space 0xFB available (this is the user-entered part of Abbreviated CDI)

          * Others reserved, must be ignored on receipt and sent as zero.

     * Write lengths supported (One byte, bit coded): (provided for devices that can only write certain sizes to
       memory) (at least one bit must be set)

          * 0x80 1 byte write

          * 0x40 2 byte write

          * 0x20 4 byte writes

          * 0x10 64 byte writes (full datagram, but not 63 bytes or arbitrary length, just exactly 64)

          * 0x02 arbitrary writes of any length OK

          * 0x01 stream writes supported (stream support will identify buffer size)

          * Others reserved, must be ignored on receipt and sent as zero.

     * Highest Address Space (byte): Highest number space available. Not all up to that need be available, but sparse
       allocation will slow down the process as “Get Address Space Information” is needed to determine whether they
       are present.

     * Lowest Address spaces (byte): Lowest number space available. Note that spaces 0xFD, 0xFE and 0xFF are assumed
       to be included even if the low space ↔ high space range doesn't include them. (also 0xFC, 0xFB of Abbreviated
       Default CDI if bits indicate they're available)

   A node that only has the high spaces could have Highest Address Space = 255, Lowest Address Space = 253 or 251.

   A node that has additional low address spaces, e.g. to make more memory available with a 28-bit address, could
   have Highest Address Space = 127, Lowest Address Space = 0 and leave the top spaces assumed.

  2.4.16 Get Address Space Information Reply

   To ease automated access, a configuring node can inquire about the address spaces in the being-configured node.
   Whether or not the address space is present, a reply is required.

     * Present: This is carried in the lowest bit of the command byte, just below the reply bit

          * 0x01 == 1: Present. == 0 not present.

     * Space ID – provided to identify request this reply is in response to

     * Highest Address (4 bytes)

     * Flags (byte) – (Alignment and size were going to be here but were made global above); Read-Only is LSB, can
       write if 0, can only read if 1; Non-zero lowest address is 2nd-lowest bit, low address is zero if 0, is
       non-zero and specified in next four bytes if 1

     * Lowest Address (4 bytes) – optional, omit if zero, as that will let reply fit in single CAN frame; if present,
       “non-zero lowest address” bit in prior byte must be 1.

     * Description (variable length) – optional null-terminated string giving the user-readable name of this space

  2.4.17 Lock/Reserve and Freeze/Unfreeze

   An OpenLCB node can, in general, be configured while the network and even the node itself is operating.

   Code can be simplified by disabling operation of a node while it's being configured, so that there's no concern
   about it trying to react to transient incomplete information. The Freeze/Unfreeze command, if supported, can be
   used to tell a node that it should “freeze” operation, ignoring inputs, while the configuration is being updated.
   A reset of the node releases the freeze option, if set.

   Although nodes can be configured by multiple other nodes, this can also lead to inconsistencies. The optional
   Lock/Release command can be used to avoid this. At the start of configuration, a configuring node sends a Lock
   message with its NodeID. If no node has locked this node, indicated by zero content in the lock memory, the
   incoming NodeID is placed in the lock memory. If a node has locked this node, the non-zero NodeID in the lock
   memory is not changed. In either case, the content of the lock memory is returned in the reply. This acts as a
   test&set operation, and informs the requesting node whether it successfully reserved the node. To release the
   node, repeat the lock operation with a zero NodeID. The lock memory is set to zero when the node is reset. Note
   that this is a voluntary protocol in the configuring nodes only; the node being configured does not change it's
   response to configuration operations when locked or unlocked.

  2.4.18 Get Unique EventID

   Nodes maintain a list of unique EventIDs for use in configuration. These are allocated based on the node's unique
   NodeID. This command allows a configuration tool to get new unique EventIDs from the node's pool, for example to
   interact with the Blue/Gold configuration process. Each request must provide a different EventID, without repeat,
   even through node resets and factory resets.

  2.4.19 Update Complete/Reset/Reboot/Reinitialize

   This is a collection of three operations, distinguished by what are normally the flag bits.

   The configuration protocol does not specify the meaning of the transferred data. In particular, it doesn't specify
   when new configuration information takes effect. Depending on how the node is constructed, this might be
   immediately upon transfer (although this raises issues of write boundaries), or when an entire sequence of
   transfers is complete. “Update Complete” is the command that indicates that a series of configuration writes is
   consistent and complete, and the node can put it into effect. Nodes do not have to require this operation, but
   receiving it must be permitted. Configuration tools should send it at the end of operations. Nodes may, but are
   not required to, reset after sending the reply to this message.

   The “Reboot/Reset” command is meant to reinitialize a node, equivalent to powering it up. Nodes should finish any
   pending operations, e.g. non-volatile memory writes, before doing the initialization. It's expected that the
   datagram reply will be sent before the reset, but this might not be entirely reliable. Configuration tools should
   not count on the reply. The configuring node will receive a “Node Initialization Complete” when the node is back
   up. This operation must not reset any configuration information to default contents.

   “Reinitialize/Factory Reset” is similar, but includes restoring the node's configuration as if factory reset.
   (This may require creating new unique EventIDs, see other note) This is a heavy-weight operation which may require
   some form of interlock, e.g. the user pressing a button, to prevent inadvertent data loss. As a small safety
   precaution, the NodeID of the note being reset is redundantly carried in the data part of the datagram.

  2.4.20 Indicate

   (This is likely to move to a separate protocol; note that “indicate” and “ident” are completely different things,
   with “ident” in a separate protocol already)

   This command tells the board to somehow identify itself to the user, for example by flashing a LED or operating
   it's outputs. This allows the user to be absolutely sure that he's configuring the correct board. “Start” (bit 0 =
   1) means that the board should start indicating, and “Stop” (bit 0 = 0) means that the board should stop
   indicating. The data portion carries information that lets the board know what kind of indication to do. It's not
   always appropriate to operate outputs if they're e.g. driving large mechanical systems like doors.
