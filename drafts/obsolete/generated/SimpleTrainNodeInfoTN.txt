                                                1 Introduction

   There is a need for something for train nodes, that uses a single message instead of datagrams and
   configuration. This allows getting getting the information with a bare minimum of support at the
   requested node end, so long as the requesting node can be sure to handle it.

   The Simple Train Information Reply message(s) carry a stream of bytes:

     * The byte 1 to indicate the version of the following content

     * A null-terminated string for the road name (i.e. “Rio Grande Southern”) is recommended, but not
       required that this string be 32 characters or less based on a single line display of a modern smart
       phone.

     * A null-terminated string for the train class (i.e. “K-27”) is recommended, but not required that
       this string be 32 characters or less based on a single line display of a modern smart phone.

     * A null-terminated string for the road number (i.e. “455”) is recommended, but not required that this
       string be 32 characters or less based on a single line display of a modern smart phone.

     * A null-terminated string for the train name (i.e “San Juan Express”) is recommended, but not
       required that this string be 32 characters or less based on a single line display of a modern smart
       phone.

     * A null-terminated string for the manufactures name  (i.e “Blackstone”) is recommended, but not
       required that this string be 32 characters or less based on a single line display of a modern smart
       phone.

     * A null-terminated string for the owners name (i.e “John Smith”) is recommended, but not required
       that this string be 32 characters or less based on a single line display of a modern smart phone.

     * [Optional] One byte to indicate Legacy Proxy Technology, see Traction Proxy Protocol.

     * [Optional] One word to indicate Legacy Proxy Train ID, see Traction Proxy Protocol.

     * [Optional] One byte to indicate Legacy Proxy Parameter 0 (for DCC this is the NMRA DCC speed steps),
       see the Traction Proxy Protocol.

     * [Optional] Remaining bytes for the Legacy Proxy Parameters depending on the Legacy Proxy Technology
       field, see the Traction Proxy Protocol.

   Note that the total length, including version numbers and nulls, must be less than [253] bytes.  This is
   based on the length of SNIP.  There is discussion as to if this limit is needed.  The argument is due to
   buffer management in a bridge between a fast and slow physical layer (Ethernet to CAN for instance).
    The bridge must buffer the entire Ethernet message then split it into CAN 8 byte messages.  Having a
   fixed max length allows fixed buffers in the software/firmware development.

   Since the size of the returned information is variable the protocol uses the Framing Bits in the
   destination address as described in the General Message Network document.  Counting null bytes and fixed
   locations for data within the data stream will not be possible with the STNIP

   The data returned by STIP must equivalent that is returned in the corresponding elements in the CDI
   Protocol.

    

2.5 Interactions

   When a node gets a Simple Train Information Request, if possible it shall reply with one or more Simple
   Train Information Reply messages containing the train information.  If it's not able to process the
   information, it shall send an Optional Interaction Rejected with an appropriate error code.

   It's recommended that the rejection message have the temporary-error bit set, so that the node sending
   the original request will retry it.

                                                3 Draft notes

   Handling a second request while sending the first: If they can't be queued for later (immediate)
   processing, the node can reply with OptionalInteractionRejected message that indicates the issue is
   temporary, and that the request should be retried if the information is still desired.  

    

   (Setting of the first/last bits to make it a message; “because this version of the specification
   predates the use of first/last bits”, nodes initiating a transfer must be able to handle a series of
   reply messages)

    

   Do nodes sending the response need to be able to resend it in response to a TerminateDueToError?  This
   might be needed is e.g. a gateway gets congested while merging frames.

    

   The information returned is intended to be considered static:  A node may request it and never have to
   request it again, because it won't change.  But the user might change the user-provided node name.  How
   will other nodes know to do a STIP request?  They don't.  Configuration tools could force themselves to
   reacquire the data, but there's no global notification of the change.  (Allowing the node to only change
   on reset would fix that, because we could have SPIP users re-request the info when they see the reset.)
