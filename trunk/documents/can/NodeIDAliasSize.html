<H1>Discussion of NodeID Alias Size on CAN Links</H1>
<P>How big should the NodeID alias field be on CAN links?</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Smaller (fewer bits) allows more payload and/or simpler
	coding of other parts of messages. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Larger allows more unique nodes to be accessed.</P>
</UL>
<P>This note describes the issues in more detail, followed by a
recommendation.</P>
<H2>Issues</H2>
<H3>Addressing</H3>
<P>The Node ID size limits the number of unique nodes that can take
part in communications on the CAN segment. Because Node ID aliases
are assigned independently on each CAN segment, the only issue is how
many different nodes are involved, not which ones they are or what
pattern(s) are available in their address numbers.</P>
<P>For electrical/timing reasons, a segment itself can only support a
maximum of about 100 nodes, but communication also involves nodes off
the segment. For example, chaining N CAN segments via bridges will
generally make up to 100*N nodes available. We have a use case of
chaining small numbers of CAN segments together, implying the need to
address 500 or 1000 nodes. 
</P>
<P>As another example, a very large network might connect many CAN
segments via TCP/IP or other networked connections. Each CAN-attached
node might need to communicate with a larger number of others spread
across that network.</P>
<P>(CAN backbone case)</P>
<H3>Collisions during Allocation</H3>
<P>The allocation process resolves collisions (attempt to use an
already allocated Node ID alias), but that takes time. Minimizing the
number of collisions is good. If the address space is just the size
of the number of things you want to address, the collisions get hard
/slow to resolve across multiple nodes. This points to having a
factor of 2, at least, between the number of nodes to be addressed
and the size of the address space.</P>
<P>(Mostly talking about separate nodes here, not just one big
interface node: Points to CAN backbone case)</P>
<H3>Size</H3>
<P>Reducing size most important (so far) in the stream protocol.</P>
<P>Events and Datagrams can be transmitted with a 16-bit alias size.</P>
<P>To get the full payload (8 bytes) for streaming requires getting
the rest of the protocol control, including two aliases for source
and destination, in the 29 bit header. Allowing 2 bits for
priority/extension, 2 for protocol control, 2 for MTI and 3 for
stream ID (all very bare minima) leads to a 10-bit node ID alias
length. 
</P>
<P>Using 1 of 8 payload bytes allows up to 14 bit node ID alias
lengths, or 12 bit node ID alias lengths with some room for expansion
and simpler MTI coding.</P>
<H3>Simplicity</H3>
<P>Byte vs nibble vs bit boundaries in code, when debugging the
protocol, etc.</P>
<P>Having extra bits available in the header allows much simpler MTI
coding, reserving specific bits for expansion instead of codes, etc.</P>
<H3>Past, Present, Future History</H3>
<P>The notional node ID alias size was originally 16 bits. Changing
it now would require some recoding of examples, and have some
political costs.</P>
<P>Enlarging it in the future would be extremely difficult. Once CAN
nodes have been produced and released in the wild, they will continue
to use the same alias fields forever, and it's not realistic to
change them. Having two separate alias field formats (“large” and
“small”) would split the protocol into two non-interoperating
formats, which is not acceptable.</P>
<H3>Filtering</H3>
<P>Having the destination short enough to be in the header allows
automated filtering of traffic.</P>
<H2>Recommendation</H2>
<P>Size considerations would push toward 10 bits, but allocation
would then limit that to about 500 nodes, and that's just too small.</P>
<P>???</P>
<H2>Alternative: Combined Stream ID and Destination Address</H2>
<P><I>(Alex Shepherd made a very interesting suggestion)</I></P>
<P>Combine destination &amp; stream ID into a smaller field, limiting
the number of streams from a given destination on a link, but
reducing the space used. (Alex) Might also allow useful filtering.
Limits number of streams on a link to <U>any</U> node, but perhaps
that's OK on a single CAN link. Limits number <U>from</U> a <U>single</U>
initiator. Does not limit number of streams to a destination, e.g.
number of people sending logging or debugging information to a node.</P>
<P>What do intermediate gateways need to do for this? Is this more
than just pre-allocating buffers for streams they have to forward,
and throwing away streams that don't have pre-allocated buffers? Can
this be done without routing tables, e.g. “Allocate buffer on
initialization message. Throw away buffer and don't forward if you
next see a data transfer, without seeing the returning
initialization, because that means that some other path is servicing
this”</P>
<P>If the gateway is doing the mapping from src/dest/streamID to
src/streamID', it might have to reject based on “not enough IDs
available” or something like that, which the upstream needs to then
retry.</P>
<P>Looks like if we allow 16 streams from a source on a single CAN
link, all fits in header, so get 8 bytes in packet.</P>
