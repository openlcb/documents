                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   OpenLCB defines various optional protocols. If another node attempts to use a protocol that the target
   node doesn't implement, there are well-defined rules for how the target node will either signal an error
   or ignore the request.

   For some uses, it's convenient to be able to tell whether a node implements a protocol before attempting
   to use it.  This protocol defines a method for doing that.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   This Standard defines an optional protocol. OpenLCB nodes may, but are not required to, implement it.

   This Standard defines message transfers that must be done via the mechanisms defined in the OpenLCB
   standards for message networking:

     * OpenLCB Message Network Standard

     * OpenLCB-CAN Message Network Standard

     * OpenLCB-TCP Message Network Standard

   Upon receipt of a Protocol Support Request message addressed to it, a node implementing this protocol
   shall return a Protocol Support Reply with correct values in the data bytes.

                                 6 Protocol Identification Values (Normative)

   A 1 bit in a position indicates that the corresponding protocol is supported by the sending node. A 0
   bit in a position indicates that the corresponding protocol is not supported by the sending node.
