                                                1 Introduction

   This Technical Note contains informative discussion and background for the corresponding “OpenLCB CAN
   Frame Transfer Standard”. This Technical Note is not normative in any way.

   For information on format and presentation conventions, see:

     * OpenLCB Common Information Technical Note

   The Frame Transfer layer of the OpenLCB-CAN stack lives above the CAN Physical Layer, and below the
   Message Network layer. It is responsible for ensuring the reliable transport of the CAN frames that make
   up OpenLCB-CAN messages.

   CAN provides reliable transport between any two nodes on a CAN segment within limitations:

    1. Every CAN header must be unique by construction. Collisions between frames with identical headers
       and no data can result in lost frames; collisions between frames with identical headers that do
       contain data do not result in well-defined behavior. Both cases must be avoided by design to avoid
       intermittent problems.

    2. CAN does not provide any indicator of which node sent a particular frame. Any node can send any
       frame, and the receiving nodes have no CAN-provided mechanism for identifying the source.

    3. It's useful to have a way of addressing a frame to be processed by a specific node, but all CAN
       nodes receive every frame.

    4. CAN does not provide a “link up” or “link down” notification. Nodes may come and go from a CAN
       segment at any time, and on an individual basis. In general, one can't assert that a particular node
       is always present, always comes up first, or never comes up first.

    5. On a busy segment, CAN frames are sent in a strict priority order, with the priority determined by
       the content of the frame headers. If multiple nodes have frames to send at the same time, the
       highest priority (lowest numerical value header) frame will be sent first. There is no concept of
       “reserved bandwidth” except through frame priority, and low-priority frames may require significant
       time to be sent.

1.1 CAN Specialization for OpenLCB

   CAN is adapted to OpenLCB use by a series of specifications which together mitigate the above
   limitations:

    1. Putting a unique source ID field in each frame ensures that the frames are unique (item 1 above),
       and provides a frame-level indicator of which node sent the frame for the purposes of monitoring,
       debugging, etc (item 2).

    2. Providing a destination address that allows a standard method of addressed communications (item 3).

    3. Using a distributed algorithm to determine the value for that ID field prevents needing a single
       “manager” to provide it, thereby handling item 4.

    4. The header bit fields discussed below are organized to handle item 5.

   Further, OpenLCB-CAN is required to work with standard CAN components (e.g., interface chips, bridges,
   computer adapters).  These standard components must not require customization to operate with OpenLCB.
    This forces a stringent requirement on protocol design, in that OpenLCB-CAN cannot require specific
   timing, deliberate creation of error cases or non-standard error handling.  

   OpenLCB-CAN is required to work without user intervention; user presets are not required for the CAN
   frame communications layer to work. The Node ID that's needed for communications is required to be
   pre-configured into the node.

   It's desirable for OpenLCB-CAN nodes to detect duplicate (non-unique) Node IDs, but 100% reliable
   detection is not required.

1.2 CAN collisions in loaded networks

   Because of the CAN priority arbitration structure, the network can run at high utilization rates. Under
   those circumstances, all nodes attempt to send their highest-priority frame, and the node with the
   absolute highest priority frame (first dominant bit) wins.  All other nodes wait until just after that
   frame and try again.  

   This behavior greatly increases the probability of collisions when multiple nodes attempt to send frames
   with the same header.

   For example, consider 5 nodes each of which want to send the high-priority frames 1, ..., 5, plus one
   more node A that wants to send the low priority frame 15.  If all those nodes attempt to send at once,
   the frames will arbitrate out and will be sent in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15.  If another node, B, also
   wants to send a frame 15, and starts to send it at any point during that entire sequence, it will end up
   colliding with the 15 that is being sent by A.  

   Particularly during layout startup, when many nodes have frames to send, this will result in an
   unacceptable probability of error, unless the protocols have been designed to have as few header
   collisions as possible, and absolutely no data collisions.

                                        2 Annotations to the Standard

   This section provides background information on corresponding sections of the Standard document. It's
   expected that two documents will be read together.

2.1 Introduction

   (Nothing to add to the Standard)

2.2 Intended Use

   The OpenLCB protocol suite uses 6-byte Node ID values, but this protocol layer could be useful in other
   contexts too. The Standard is therefore written so that any Node ID length through 7*12 = 84 bits can be
   used in a straight-forward manner.

2.3 References and Context

   Note that the Standard references the Unique ID Standard, but only to the extent that each node is
   required to have a unique ID as its node ID. The Standard would work equally well with a Unique ID that
   was allocated via any mechanism, and with any length from 12 through 84 bits. OpenLCB uses a 48-bit
   unique ID as a node ID, which is assumed for the rest of this Technical Note.

2.4 Frame Format

   Standard header frames are also known as CAN 2.0A frames. Extended header frames are also known as CAN
   2.0B frames.

   OpenLCB uses a straight-forward transfer of extended-header frames, using no special features, to reduce
   complexity and increase robustness.

   The Standard is silent on the uses for standard CAN (11-bit header) frames. The proper-operation
   requirement is so nodes will tolerate them in case they're needed for other purposes. The Atmel
   bootloader1 uses standard frames, for example, and the Microchip bootloader2 can also use them.
    Allowing standard frames then allows the use of these bootloaders in parallel with OpenLCB-CAN.
    Similarly, CBUS3 uses standard frames, and therefore could coexist with OpenLCB on a CAN segment.

   This proper-operation requirement could also have been phrased as “shall ignore ...”, but the current
   phrasing is thought to be more exact.

   RTR frames are not used in the protocol because CAN semantics require a specific use for them, which has
   been built into some silicon implementations. There are also some arbitration issues, see: CiA
   Application Note 802 (2005)4 and http://www.thecanmancan.com/?tag=rtr for more information.

   A CAN node can emit an overload frame when “Due to internal conditions, the node is not yet able to
   begin reception of the next (frame). A node may generate a maximum of two sequential overload frames to
   delay the start of the next (frame).” Those frames are 17 to 23 extra bit times each.5 The protocol does
   not specify transmission of overload frames because not all CAN controller hardware can deliberately
   send them. We require that nodes be able to handle them because some CAN controller hardware will
   occasionally send them automatically.

   People will occasionally refer to a restriction against having seven 1 bits in the top 11 bits of the
   CAN header. There is no such restriction, and the statements are the result of a misunderstanding. There
   is a restriction against having seven consecutive recessive bits on the CAN segment, but sending seven
   consecutive 1 bits will not result in this. CAN uses a bit-stuffing technique to prevent that by
   inserting a dominant bit on the line after the fifth consecutive recessive bit, and removing it at the
   receiver.

   The CAN format has been allocated on nibble boundaries to make it easier to read dumps of packets. The
   header is considered to be right (LSB) aligned.

   The reserved most-significant bit (MSB) is likely to be used as a priority-boost bit in the future, for
   example so that a gateway can gain priority access to the CAN segment for various operations that
   require synchronization or atomicity. CAN encodes “do first” priority as 0 and “do later” as 1, so the
   Standard requires that a 1 bit be sent. To preserve the utility of this, nodes must not require either a
   1 nor 0 on receipt. It is therefore not available as a protocol expansion bit.

   The second-most-significant bit (0x0800,0000) when 0 indicates that the frame is for local control on
   the CAN segment.  Those frames should never leave the CAN segment. When 1, it indicates that the frame
   is carrying OpenLCB message traffic, which can leave the CAN segment to proceed to the rest of the
   network; see the message-level documentation for more information on that.

   The order of the header fields was chosen to get proper priority and access disambiguation via CAN's
   standard mechanisms.

2.5 States

   In the Inhibited state, a node can only communicate on the CAN segment to allocate its Node ID
   alias(es).  This involves sending CID and RID frames with a tentative Node ID alias value.  Once that
   process is complete, the node has an assigned Node ID alias and can transition to the Permitted state,
   where all communications are possible.

   If a node fails, it should restart in the Inhibited state. In general, this state transition is not
   visible to other nodes until the failed node starts communicating.

   Designers of nodes that maintain alias pools, for example in gateways, need to carefully consider to
   what extent the state applies to the entire node, and to what extent it applies to each individual alias
   in the gateway pool. Anything that transmits OpenLCB frames on CAN needs to have reserved an alias and
   have transitioned to Permitted state by transmitting an Alias Map Definition frame using that particular
   alias.  It can acquire and stock-pile other aliases for later use, putting them into Permitted state
   either immediately or at some later time.

2.6 CAN-specific Control Frames and Interactions

  2.6.1 Control Frame Format

   RID, CID, etc frames are assigned low numbers to give them higher transmission priority.

   The coding is done to allow up to 7 separate CID sequence numbers, for use by protocols with longer node
   IDs.

   The coding of the 0x07NN field was selected to allow expansion of control fields in the 0x070N range,
   and expansion of error indications in the 0x071N range.

   The block of CAN frames with Variable field from 0x1000 to 0x3FFF are not used by OpenLCB.  Although
   formally reserved, they can serve as a convenient 26-bit (with bit 28) address block for experimentation
   and migration of other equipment.

  2.6.2 Interactions

   Communications protocols are about more than formats. The protocols must also specify the interactions
   in which the frames are used.

    2.6.2.1 Reserving a Node ID Alias

   At the highest level, this algorithm is broadcasting the tentative alias to see if any other node is
   checking the same tentative alias. If it is in use, the algorithm tries additional ones until it finds
   one that's available.  The following considerations had to be taken into account when designing the
   alias reservation algorithm.  

   CAN arbitration reliably avoids collisions between frames with unique headers. It does not guarantee
   non-overlapping transmission from separate nodes of frames with identical headers and no data; if the
   timing is right, they may overlay each other such that only one frame appears to have been sent. It is
   very difficult to ensure that two nodes always send initialization packets only at different times,
   particularly given the load-related frame synchronization issue described earlier. In addition, CAN will
   eventually signal an error if two packets with the same header and different data payloads collide, but
   not all CAN interface hardware provides reliable indications about why that error occurred.

   If a node sends out a check frame containing just the alias, then it could expect that another node to
   complain if it has the same alias. This would work, except in the (admittedly unlikely) case where both
   nodes send out the identical check frame simultaneously. Neither would recognize a conflict and both
   would consider that they own the same alias. Therefore, a method needed to be found that guaranteed that
   the check frame(s) are unique, even if they are sent simultaneously.

   The CID/RID algorithm for finding aliases is designed to work with CAN arbitration, but without causing
   any CAN errors. During execution of the algorithm, some frames might have the same header. They
   therefore have to have the same contents, including null contents, or else a non-arbitration error can
   occur.

   If two nodes have taken the same tentative alias, at least one of the packets used in the broadcast will
   not be identical between the two nodes, because their Node IDs are different in at least one bit. CAN
   will successfully arbitrate this, and one node will receive the frame sent by the other node, causing it
   to back off.

   CAN transmissions are not atomic operations; a node can receive a frame between the time it tells the
   hardware to send a frame and the time that frame is actually sent. It's therefore possible for both
   nodes contending for the same alias value to back off and try again. The mechanism for generating the
   next alias value to try must generate different values for different nodes to prevent this from becoming
   a permanent lock-step error.

   The delay at the end of the algorithm is to ensure that higher latency nodes, such as software nodes
   working through USB converters, can reply to CID frames from nodes that come up on a working link.
   OpenLCB is a soft-real-time system, and software that's interacting with it needs to have response times
   of a couple tens of milliseconds or better to be reliable. The algorithm provides a wait of a few times
   that to enable those programs to take part.

   Nodes may assign different alias values each time they are powered up. There is no requirement that they
   always reserve and use the same one, nor is it possible to guarantee that they will.

   The sequence number MMM is sent in descending order, 0x7, 0x6, …, to give priority on the CAN segment to
   frames later in the process.  This lets some nodes complete as early as possible and remove themselves
   from contention.

   Although it might be a useful debugging tool, putting the full NID in the data portion of the frames can
   cause errors. Therefore, we decided not to do that.

   Reserving a node ID alias value is separate from actually using it to take a node from Inhibited to
   Permitted state.  A gateway device, for example, might want want to stockpile a few reserved alias
   values so that they can be rapidly associated with a specific node that wants to communicate. The node
   ID that's broken into four parts for the CID values needs to be unique, but it does not have to be the
   one that's eventually attached to the alias via a Alias Map Definition frame later on.  

   For example, a minimal sequence is four CID frames and a RID:

   0x17123FED

   0x16456FED

   0x15789FED

   0x14ABCFED

   0x10700FED

   The red nibbles show that these are four CID and one RID frames.  The blue nibbles are the source ID
   alias being tested and allocated. The yellow nibbles are the underlying Node ID of the node, in this
   case 12 34 56 78 9A BC.

    2.6.2.2 Transition to Permitted State

   Note that there is no requirement that the node's alias value be consistent from one power-up reset to
   the next.

    2.6.2.3 Node ID Alias validation

   The Alias Mapping Enquiry provides a mechanism for determining which alias is associated with each Node
   ID.  This can be used when a new node attaches and needs the information.  Operating nodes can also
   track this information by watching CAN segment traffic for control frames, without having to use the
   Alias Mapping Enquiry protocol.

   The AME has two distinct usages:

     * AME without Node ID: all active nodes reply with AMD and their Node ID;

     * AME with Node ID and the receiving node has matching Node ID, it replies with AMD and its Node ID;

    

   Node ID alias validation provides a way for a node joining a segment to rapidly learn the Node IDs and
   Node ID aliases of the reachable nodes.  This may be useful for e.g. a gateway that is connecting two
   segments that are already in operation, or a monitor node who wants to determine that all nodes have
   come up properly.

   In general, simple or regular nodes won't need to do node alias validation.  Those nodes don't need to
   keep track of the Node ID to alias mapping, because they simply respond to frames they receive that
   contain an alias.  They just work with the alias itself. They also don't need to track other nodes'
   state, etc.

   In order to acquire the map between CAN aliases and node IDs, a gateway needs to be able to send a CAN
   frame requiring "everybody reply with your node ID". Much like Ethernet gateway mapping, this needs to
   return the node ID of just the specific CAN-attached hardware, not all the node IDs that can be e.g.
   reached through one or more gateways, so it needs to be a segment-specific frame defined only at the CAN
   level. It must not be a OpenLCB common message, though higher level protocols may want to provide a
   similar capability that spans the entire OpenLCB installation.

    2.6.2.4 Transition to Inhibited State

   The Alias Map Reset frame indicates that the alias value in the source address field may no longer be
   associated with the same NID, and mapping tables should be reset.

   The full node ID in the Alias Map Reset frame allows nodes who only are aware of an alias for their
   conversation partner to convert that alias to a full node ID for later use.

   This is a way to release or reuse an alias, while informing everybody that the node is no longer
   reachable.

   The alias is only released if this node allows some other node to allocate it via CID/RID frames.  The
   current node can still hang on to it if desired, for example to reuse it with another Node ID, by
   replying to CID/RID frames from another node attempting to reserve it.

   Gateways have to obtain unique aliases for remote nodes they are proxying onto the segment. Gateways
   maintain the mapping between remote node's node ID and the local alias. If they need to break that
   mapping, e.g. because they need to re-purpose a local alias due to resource limitations in the mapping
   tables, they must send a "Alias Map Reset" frame to force nodes to drop their alias information. "Alias
   Map Reset" is a CAN-specific frame limited to the segment, but all gateways on the segment must act on
   it.  This is then followed by an "Alias Map Definition" when the alias is allocated to a new node ID.  

   Regular nodes won't need to do this. They stay active until they go instantly offline due to e.g.
   power-off.

   When a node goes to inhibited state or releases an alias by sending an Alias Map Reset frame, that's
   telling other nodes that it can no longer be reached by using that alias.  The last paragraph in this
   section of the Standard gives the node receiving the Alias Map Reset 100msec to finish processing and
   stop using the alias.  If it still needs to send messages to the node that sent the Alias Map Reset, the
   receiving node can attempt to reacquire a new alias via an Alias Map Enquire frame or higher-level
   message(s).  If the alias has changed, that will work, but if the sending node has transitioned to
   Inhibited state there will be no reply to the attempt to obtain the new alias.

    2.6.2.5 Node ID Alias Collision Handling

   During normal operation in the Permitted state on a single CAN segment, a node should never encounter a
   Node ID alias collision.

   They can happen when network topology changes, for example when connecting two operating CAN segments.
   In that case, nodes on the two segments have assigned aliases independently, and can have used the same
   value.  The underlying Node IDs do not collide, because they are assigned globally uniquely, but that's
   not sufficient to ensure that the shorter aliases are independent.

   In the case of a collision, one or both nodes will release the current alias. If it's the alias that was
   used to go to Permitted state, e.g. the current alias being used by this node, the node must also drop
   back to Inhibited state. The node(s) then can, but is not required to, return to Permitted state with a
   new alias. In the process the node(s) will emit “Alias Map Reset” and “Alias Map Definition” frame that
   will allow any gateway(s) to update their maps.

   The preceding paragraph and the language of the Standard is complicated because it has to cover the case
   of a gateway or similar node who has reserved a number of node ID aliases, but is not currently using
   them as a node.  In other words, the reservation CID/RID process has completed to reserve the alias, but
   no mapping of the alias to a specific node ID has been published.

   Simple leaf nodes don't keep internal mappings between full node IDs and aliases, so this transition
   will not cause any problems for them unless they are currently in communication with another node, e.g.
   in the middle of a sequence of frames for a datagram or stream.  In that case, the node may have to
   invoke higher-level error handling to cause the sequence to be retried.

   For example, a detachable throttle will detect that it's reattaching, reserve an alias value, and then
   enter permitted state with that value.  Since the reservation happened while connected to the current
   CAN segment, there is no possibility of a duplicate.

   Example:  Nodes A and B are in Permitted mode with different node IDs, but the same alias values.  Some
   gateway node C requests a list of all nodes on the CAN segment:

   C: 0x10702ccc (AME frame)

   A: 0x10701nnn 01 02 03 04 05 06  (AMD frame with Node ID 0x0102,0304,0506)

   (For simplicity, B has not transmitted yet) B discovers that it's alias has been duplicated.

   B: 0x10703nnn 55 AA 44 AA 33 AA (AMR frame with Node ID 0x55AA,44AA,33AA)

   Node A also discovers that it's alias has been duplicated.

   A: 0x10703nnn 01 02 03 04 05 06 (AMR frame with Node ID  0x0102,0304,0506)

   B then goes back into operation by reserving a new alias value and transitioning to Permitted state:

   B: 0x1755Ammm (1st CID)

   B: 0x16A44mmm (2nd CID)

   B: 0x15AA3mmm (3rd CID)

   B: 0x143AAmmm (4th CID)

   Node A will also reserve a new alias.

   A: 0x17010kkk (1st CID)

   A: 0x16203kkk (2nd CID)

   A: 0x15040kkk (3rd CID)

   A: 0x14506kkk (4th CID)

   After 200 ms both nodes finish their alias reservation and transition to Permitted state.

   B: 0x10700mmm (RID)

   B: 0x10701mmm 55 AA 44 AA 33 AA (AMD with B's node ID attached)

   A: 0x10700kkk (RID)

   A: 0x10701kkk 01 02 03 04 05 06 (AMD with A's node ID attached)

    2.6.2.6 Duplicate Node ID Handling

   This should never happen, of course, but it's possible that two nodes will have the same Node ID
   assigned.  This will result in frame loss and operational difficulties. OpenLCB does not guarantee
   prompt detection of this condition, at any level of the protocol stack, but it's extremely likely that
   it will be detected. At the Frame Transfer level, two nodes on the same CAN segment sharing a common
   Node ID will be detected when a node receives a Alias Map Definition frame that contains its own Node
   ID.

   The “in addition to any other actions” refers to e.g. acting on identical alias values, should that also
   be the case.

   Sending the PCER message is level jumping, in that such messages are defined at a much higher level in
   the protocol stack. We include it here because it allows a much cleaner set of error handling operations
   using the event producer/consumer techniques associated with OpenLCB. This decision can be revisited.

   After sending the (optional) PCER message, the node has to go offline so that it doesn't interact
   anymore until the user resets it to restart operation.  This is necessary to prevent the PCER itself
   triggering additional messages back, resulting in a never-ending cycle.

   Example:  Nodes A and B are in Permitted mode with the same node IDs, but different aliases.  Some
   gateway node C requests a list of all nodes on the CAN segment:

   C: 0x10702ccc (AME frame)

   A: 0x10701aaa 01 02 03 04 05 06  (AMD frame with Node ID 0x010203040506)

   (For simplicity, B has not transmitted yet) B discovers that its node ID has been duplicated.

   B: 0x195B4bbb 01 01 00 00 00 00 02 01  (Producer-Consumer Event Report (PCER) message with event ID
   0x0101,0000,0000,0201 )

   If the two nodes have also assigned the same alias value, that interaction is also invoked here.

    2.6.2.7 Reporting CAN Link Status

   The CAN Standard defines the “Error Active”, “Error Inactive” and “bus off” states, along with extensive
   fault-confinement rules.  By using qualified CAN implementations, OpenLCB-CAN nodes pick these behaviors
   up. The interactions in this section are then about reporting the results of the CAN Standard
   operations. The “Error Information Report 0” through “Error Information Report 3” control frames
   indicate specific transitions in the node's state.  No OpenLCB-CAN node is required to react to those
   reports. The reports only provide information.

   Designers of monitoring equipment that attaches to the CAN link can use this information directly.
   Designers of gateway nodes that connect CAN segments together or connect CAN segments to other types of
   OpenLCB links may want to convert these control frames (which are not allowed to go off their original
   CAN segment) to higher level messages.  There are well-known EventIDs for this purpose, but that use is
   beyond the scope of this Standard and Technical Note.

   Since CAN nodes are required by the CAN standard to initialize in Bus Active state, no Error Information
   N frame(s) can be emitted at startup.  They cannot be emitted until there's an actual state transition
   in the interface.

   It's not possible for a node to emit a frame to indicate that it has entered the “Bus Off” state, so
   there's no message corresponding to that.

  2.6.3 Node ID Alias Generation

   We have a preferred implementation for node ID alias generation which is described in Section 6
   “Preferred Alias Allocation Method” below.

   The Standard is written to specify the minimum needed to ensure proper operation. This allows developers
   to create other implementations if needed.

   The term “of the same type” is meant to cover “from the same manufacturer”. The idea is that
   manufacturer will likely number their boards sequentially, and it's possible that an OpenLCB
   installation will have multiple boards from the same manufacturer.  This rule just says that the low
   bits of the sequential number appear in the alias, so that boards from a single manufacturer are not
   likely to collide.

   Two other criteria that were considered:

     * The sequence of alias values generated by a node shall depend on the node's node ID in such a way
       that the sequence differs from the sequence generated by every other node.

     * Given sufficient iterations, the sequence of alias values generated by a node shall include every
       valid alias value.

   Although useful criteria, they were omitted as too hard to comprehensively test.

   What's really necessary, but hard to describe in standard language, is that two separate nodes need to
   have different sequences of generated numbers.  If node A will try 3, 4, 5, 6, … then it's important
   that node B try some other sequence. If B also  generates values in the sequence 3, 4, 5, 6, … then the
   two nodes can get locked to each other trying the same value, both rejecting it, and then trying the
   same new value.

   Formally, if Ai is defined as a particular value in node A's sequence, Bi is defined as a particular
   value in B's sequence, then “if Ai = Bi, then Ai+1 != Bi+1 most of the time” is the important condition.

   It's not required that two sequential aliases be different.  It's possible that the sequence generator
   will come up with the same value occasionally, and the RID/CID mechanism is constructed to handle that.
    The sequence on the CAN bus will be clearer, and in some cases the allocation process will be faster,
   if nodes identify duplicate aliases in sequence, and just go on to the next one.

   Note that in the diagram above, the 'Fails' are due to the node receiving a message which uses its
   tentative Alias, and it therefore needs to back off and try a new tentative Alias.  

    

                                      3 Gateways and segment management

   Multiple CAN electrical regions can be connected into a single CAN segment via repeaters that allow the
   entire segment to share arbitration.  The OpenLCB-CAN frame-level protocol was designed to work with
   these:  It doesn't use RTR frames, and negotiates aliases over top of the CAN arbitration.

   Bridges, which work by passing frames between separate segments, are also supported.  In normal
   operation, OpenLCB-CAN frames can be transported through those bridges unchanged. While the bridge is
   active, the alias negotiation system will work properly.  If a bridge is inactive, e.g. the two segments
   are separate, while nodes are coming up and allocating their aliases, it's possible that duplicate
   aliases will be allocated.  Bringing up the CAN bridge hardware before bringing up the nodes prevents
   duplicate assignment.  If duplicates are assigned, e.g. due to bringing up a bridge between active CAN
   segments, the nodes will discover the duplicates on their first transmission, and will rectify the
   situation using the procedure defined in the “Node ID Alias Collision Handling” section.

   Higher-capability bridges, and gateways to non-CAN OpenLCB networks, will want to handle the assignment
   of local aliases directly.  This prevents alias collisions between separate CAN segments, and allows
   very large OpenLCB networks, but requires more work from the gateway.  It will allocate a pool of
   aliases using the conventional technique, and then assign them to off-segment nodes as they need to
   communicate on the segment.  Many algorithms are possible for that assignment.

   If/when a full NID is needed, it can be obtained by sending an "Alias Mapping Enquiry" frame with an
   appropriate Destination Node ID in local alias form. The reply will eventually come back with the Source
   ID in local alias form and carrying the full NID in the frame body.

                                   4 Throughput and Temporarily Deaf Nodes

   29-bit extended header and 8-byte payload results in a total transmission taking about 135 bit times,
   varying slightly with bit-stuffing.

   125Kbps with max-length extended header frames is about 900 frames/second. CAN is very good at running
   at 100% utilization, so long as nodes can keep up and a proper set of priorities is in place. The CAN
   network itself does not require any inter-frame spacing, limitations on bandwidth usage, etc; the
   segment can be allowed to run at 100%.

   OpenLCB requires that CAN-attached nodes be able to handle the full frame rate on the CAN bus. There is
   no guarantee that frames for a given node will arrive with non-zero time between then.

   Some nodes are not always able to process frames. For example, the node may cease processing for a short
   time while writing non-volatile memory. Higher-level protocols, e.g. configuration write datagrams, have
   mechanisms built in to prevent overrun while writing configuration memory, but there could be multiple
   activities going on in parallel that will result in frames arriving while the node is not processing.

   Short outages can be covered by CAN hardware buffering, so long as the node will eventually catch up
   even at full arrival rate. Outages long enough that frames are lost due to e.g. buffer overflow require
   a  node to broadcast that it's back up if the hardware detected frames lost. This is because there could
   have been frames of some form that modified the OpenLCB node state, which are now lost (e.g. drop alias,
   CID/RID in absence, or even higher level events)

   The real limitation is whether the nodes themselves can handle the full rate of frame arrival. There is
   (currently) no mechanism in OpenLCB to throttle the rate of frames arriving at a node, nor is it easy to
   create one in a CAN network. The stream and datagram protocol have been designed to allow a node to
   efficiently use a very limited amount of buffer memory, but don't provide mechanisms to limit the
   arrival of frames in general. Nodes must handle full rate frames, specifically including frames not
   addressed to them. For long term reliability, a node must be able to completely process an entire CAN
   frame in the time it takes to receive the next one, which may be as little as 64 bit times, or about 500
   microseconds for a header only frame.

   Eventually OpenLCB may have to discuss use of Overload Frames to throttle for e.g. NVRAM writing, but
   various CAN hardware implementations may also be doing this already. This mechanism provides only a
   little more time, due to restrictions in the CAN specification that have become limitations on the
   silicon implementations.

                                   5 On the choice of a 12-bit alias length

   The size of the 12-bit NodeID alias field was selected by balancing two constraints:

     * Smaller (fewer bits) allows more payload and/or simpler coding of other parts of messages.

     * Larger allows more unique nodes to be accessed.

5.1 Issues

  5.1.1 Addressing

   The alias size limits the number of unique nodes that can take part in communications on the CAN
   segment. Because Node ID aliases are assigned independently on each CAN segment, the only issue is how
   many different nodes are involved, not which ones they are or what pattern(s) are available in their
   address numbers.

   For electrical/timing reasons, a segment itself can only support a maximum of about 100 nodes6, but
   communication also involves nodes off the segment. For example, chaining N CAN segments via bridges will
   generally make up to 100*N nodes available. We have a use case of chaining small numbers of CAN segments
   together, implying the need to address 500 or 1000 nodes.

   As another example, a very large network might connect many CAN segments via TCP/IP or other networked
   connections. Each CAN-attached node might need to communicate with a larger number of others spread
   across that network.

   Finally, one can imagine connecting a few CAN segments in a star pattern to a central OpenLCB-CAN
   “backbone”, which must route the full cross-segment traffic.

   In some cases, we want two aliases (source and destination), plus a few more bits, in the 29 bits total
   available in the header. Using 12-bits for each address leaves 29-(2*12) = 5 bits for these purposes,
   which seemed about right, and allows a maximum of 2^12, or 4096 nodes.  

  5.1.2 Collisions during Allocation

   The alias allocation process resolves collisions (attempt to use an already allocated Node ID alias),
   but that takes time. Minimizing the number of collisions is good. If the address space is just the size
   of the number of things you want to address, the collisions get hard /slow to resolve across multiple
   nodes. This points to having a factor of 2, at least, between the number of nodes to be addressed and
   the size of the address space.

  5.1.3 Size

   Streaming provides the most stringent test of alias sizes. We'd like to have all 8 bytes of CAN frame
   payload available for transporting stream data, which requires putting both source and destination
   addresses, plus whatever control information is needed, into the header.

   To get the full payload (8 bytes) for streaming requires getting the rest of the protocol control,
   including two aliases for source and destination, in the 29 bit header. Allowing 1 bit for
   priority/extension, 1 for protocol control, 3 for MTI and stream control (all very bare minimum) leads
   to a 12-bit node ID alias length.

                                     6 Preferred Alias Allocation Method

   This section documents the preferred algorithm for generating unique Node ID aliases.

   CAN transmissions are not atomic operations; you can receive a frame between the time you tell the
   hardware to send a frame and the time that frame is actually sent. It's therefore possible for both
   nodes contending for the same alias value to back off and try again. Using the pseudo-random number
   generator as a sequence number makes it likely that the next attempt will be made using different alias
   values in the two nodes. The use of a sequence generator also makes the arbitration process faster in
   the case of sequential Node ID values. People like to use small and sequential numbers for things, and
   the sequence generator maps those to very different values that are less likely to collide during
   arbitration.

6.1 Preferred alias generation algorithm

   The 12 bit alias has to be derived from a 48-bit sequence number in a way that keeps as much entropy
   (distinctiveness; randomness) as possible.

   The entropy starts in the node ID values, which cover a 48-bit space (albeit non-uniformly).  This
   provides an initial 48-bit value that can be mapped to a 12-bit value.

   To create a sequence of values, you want a computationally cheap way of sequencing through all those
   possible 48-bit values.  (Running through the 48-bit values and compressing each to a 12-bit alias value
   is less likely to get multiple nodes attempting the same sequence than just working through a 12-bit
   sequence) A suitable pseudo-random number generator does exactly this: it runs through full 48-bit
   sequence, with each node starting at separate point in the sequence, so the 48 bit values are unique.

   A computationally convenient way to create a 12-bit value, while preserving as much of the randomness as
   possible, is to break the 48-bit value into four 12-bit values, align these, and exclusive-or them.
    Each bit-change in the original 48-bit number then becomes a change in the final 12-bit value.

   Sequentially numbered nodes will have initial seeds that differ only in the low bits of the PRNG output.
   For shift-register PRNGs, this can present a problem, as all bytes of the result are shifting together
   with just one new bit shifting in at the top. (Traditionally, shift-register PRNGs shift toward the LSB)
   Only one bit changes.  Combining bytes (or even 12-bit chunks) via XOR or add operations results in
   reduced entropy.

   The OpenLCB proposed PRNG (next section) uses add operations with a constant term to avoid this problem,
   so treating the 48-bit PRNG output as four 12-but values, which are then XORed, works well.

  6.1.1 Preferred PRNG

   The proposed 48-bit PRNG is from “A 48-Bit Pseudo-Random Number Generator”, Heidi G. Kuehn,
   Communications of the ACM, Volume 4, Issue 8 (August 1961), pages 350-352.

   xi+1 = (29+1) xi + c

   where c = 29,741,096,258,473 or 0x1B0CA37A4BA9.The paper actually describes a PRNG that uses signed
   arithmetic, but for our purposes the 48th “sign” bit isn't important. This is a byte+bit shift and add,
   so it's quick to calculate.

   Note that, unlike some other PNRGs, this one can generate a zero result, and can accept a zero seed.

   It is initialized with the node ID as a 48-bit key, with the most significant byte of the node ID as the
   most-significant byte of the PRNG value.

  6.1.2 Preferred PRNG to node ID alias mapping

   The 12-bit node ID alias is made from the 48-bit PRNG value by splitting the PRGN value into four 12-bit
   values and XORing them together.  This preserves the information content of every bit in the final
   result.

  6.1.3 Example C implementation7

   The PRNG state is stored in two 32-bit quantities:

     uint32_t lfsr1, lfsr2; // sequence value: lfsr1 is upper 24 bits, lfsr2 lower

   The 6-byte unique Node ID is stored in the nid[0:5] array.

   To load the PRNG from the Node ID:

     lfsr1 = (nid[0] << 16) | (nid[1] << 8) | nid[2];

     lfsr2 = (nid[3] << 16) | (nid[4] << 8) | nid[5];

   To step the PRNG:

      // First, form 2^9*val

      uint32_t temp1 = ((lfsr1<<9) | ((lfsr2>>15)&0x1FF)) & 0xFFFFFF;

      uint32_t temp2 = (lfsr2<<9) & 0xFFFFFF;

    

      // add

      lfsr2 = lfsr2 + temp2 + 0x7A4BA9l;

      lfsr1 = lfsr1 + temp1 + 0x1B0CA3l;

    

      // carry

      lfsr1 = (lfsr1 & 0xFFFFFF) | ((lfsr2&0xFF000000) >> 24);

      lfsr2 = lfsr2 & 0xFFFFFF;

   Form a 12-bit alias from the PRNG state:

   uint16_t LinkControl::getAlias() {

     return (lfsr1 ^ lfsr2 ^ (lfsr1>>12) ^ (lfsr2>>12) )&0xFFF;

   }
