OpenLCB Specification Conventions</H1>
<P>OpenLCB is not a formal standards-making body, but we are
interested in making it clear what's required and not required for
interoperation between OpenLCB nodes. Therefore, we are creating a
series documents that are intended to form a stable basis for OpenLCB
implementors.</P>
<P>At the same time, we're interested in forwarding the NMRA's effort
to create a common standard, so we're proposing documents to them and
cooperating in those discussions. More information on that effort can
be found on a <A HREF="../srpdrafts/index.html">separate page</A>.</P>
<P>We're creating three general types of documents:</P>
<DL>
	<DT><I>Standards </I>
	</DT><DD>
	Standards are agreed to be normative, to the extent that anything
	this bunch of happy campers does can be proscriptive. A statement
	should be included in a standard when it's &quot;clearly necessary&quot;
	and &quot;clearly correct&quot;. 
	</DD><DT>
	<I>Technical Notes</I></DT><DD>
	These are agreed-to documents that explain a standard and provide
	stable information useful to implementors. Statements should be
	included in a technical note when they are &quot;likely to be
	useful&quot; and &quot;not clearly wrong&quot;; this is a lower
	standard than the one for standards. Opinions and less-desirable
	options are OK when clearly labelled as such. 
	</DD><DT>
	<I>Development documents </I>
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	These are things that are in significant flux, but still useful to
	developers and implementers. 
	</DD></DL>
<P>
The first two can appear in &quot;preliminary&quot;, &quot;draft&quot;
or &quot;adopted&quot; form. Adopted documents have received
extensive review, and one can rely on their content. &quot;Draft&quot;
documents are complete, but still under discussion. &quot;Preliminary&quot;
documents are still being written, will certainly change very much
during that process, and in general are only of interest to the
people actively working to advance the protocol in that particular
area.</P>
<P>Generally, an implementer should start with the relevant adopted
standards and be sure to understand what's really required for the
implementation to work well. Then, the implementor should move on to
the adopted technical notes to make sure the background is
understood, learn about issues to be considered and decisions to be
made, and get information about possible approaches. Finally, the
implementer may want to spend time on the draft and development
documents to get an idea of what the future might bring.</P>
<P>The work to date is available <A HREF="index.html">here</A> for
Standards and Technical Notes, and <A HREF="../documents/index.html">here</A>
for development documents.</P>
<P>OpenLCB is loosely versioned.  Documents can be referenced via
their last change date, which is displayed at the upper right of the
first page of every document. Older versions can be retrieved by date
from SVN.  The collection of documents is given a version number,
such as 0.5, on the specification index page.  That number is updated
when the specifications (and associated implementations) are changed
in a way that breaks compatibility with existing adopted documents
and/or shipped code.  The pre-decimal digit(s) represent fundamental
structures such as basic state machines and protocols; the
post-decimal digit(s) represent minor changes to values and field
sizes.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Implementation Points:</H3>
<P>We write stuff in bog-standard Open Office .odf format by
convention. The <A HREF="drafts/Template.odt">drafts/Template.odt</A>
file is a starting point. Leave change tracking on, because that
helps handle collisions between two people who might be editing at
overlapping times. Commit back to SVN early and often to avoid
collisions.</P>
<P>(We have considered DocBook and other formats in the past, may
still go that way, but don't want to invest in the infrastructure
now)</P>
<P>To make direct access easier, the file naming convention is
(wire)(topic)(type).html, in Pascal case (leading-capital camel
case). For example, &quot;CanMessageTransportS.html&quot; vs
&quot;CanMessageTransportTN.html&quot; vs
&quot;TcpMessageTransportS.html&quot;. Use &quot;Gen&quot; for the
general case, true for any wire protocol.</P>
<P>&quot;Shall&quot; should get used in standards in preference to
&quot;must&quot;. The reason for this is that &quot;The board shall
be flat...&quot; reads as a statement about the board, but using
&quot;must&quot; makes it seem a statement about what you, the
designer or manufacturer, must do. &quot;Must&quot; is OK in
technical notes, which are more information and non-normative:
&quot;Designers must remember that wires get hot...&quot; 
</P>
<P>Standards can describe options using &quot;Devices may, but are
not required to, ...&quot;, but they can also just be silent about
options.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The various parts of standards should
be identified as normative or informative, because there are always
non-normative parts of standards. Try to keep the informative parts
in the explanation technical note, but when they need to be present
so the standard can be read by itself, be sure to label them clearly.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Generally, standards should use short
paragraphs focused on a single point. Think of the paragraphs as unit
tests, which should be individually satisfied (or not).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Make the status of &quot;reserved&quot;
things clear: &quot;Shall be set to 1 on creation and shall not
checked upon reception&quot; and &quot;Shall be set to 1 on creation,
and shall be received as 1 to be considered valid&quot; are
different. One works for a bit that's reserved for some orthogonal
future expansion; the other is needed to define an exclusive (hence
non-orthogonal) future option.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Make numbers clear instead of using &quot;large&quot; or &quot;small&quot;.
(One web page referred to OpenLCB being usable unchanged on &quot;up
to huge modular layouts&quot;, which engendered a long discussion in
July 2011; we decided that meant &quot;up to 4999 nodes&quot; and at
5000 or above you might have to do special things to handle traffic)</P>
