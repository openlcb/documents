  Layout Command Control - Executive Summary

    

   Layout Command Control (LCC) is an accessory bus system that bridges between layout accessories, train
   traction systems and legacy systems.  It is designed to run across numerous transports, including
   Ethernet, WiFi, CAN, and RF.  It is also designed to umbrella legacy systems into a unified whole.  

    

   LCC allows manufacturers wide latitude to innovate, while having a solid base from which to build that
   ensures compatibility.  This lets them access a larger market, while focusing on their area of
   expertise, and remaining compatible and connected to everyone's products.  To this end, LCC includes a
   testing suite that not only allows manufacturers to self-check their compliance, but also allows
   modelers to assure themselves that their equipment is working and maintains compatibility.  

    

   Modelers do not need to throw out their legacy equipment, but can easily connect to LCC, and hence to
   other legacy systems, through smart-bridges – devices which know how to buffer and translate from one
   system to LCC and back.   LCC has a very large address-space which can accommodate lots of systems with
   ease.  Every item (node) has a pre-assigned unique identifier number which is used to address it.
    Because these are unique, there cannot be clashes between two nodes.  Modular groups can come together
   without conflicts, and advanced features allow them to quickly configure their ad hoc layout.  

    

   LCC is well documented by the OpenLCB development team as a set of standard Protocols which generally
   follow the OSI layering scheme.  These Standards documents form a complete and concise basis to build
   compliant nodes.  In addition, the matching Technical Notes explain in greater detail both the intent
   and examples of the use of the Standards.  Each pair of documents describes and teaches a specific
   protocol, and the protocols are designed to be internally extensible but also to form the basis of newer
   application protocols.  

    

   In summary, LCC forms a solid infrastructure that allows modelers to use the old, but use the new, and
   grow into the future.
