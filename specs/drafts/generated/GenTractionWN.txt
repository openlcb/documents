                                                1 Introduction

   This working note covers the Traction Protocol, the way that OpenLCB handles moving objects such as
   locomotives, engines, and other rolling stock.

   A Working Note is an intermediate step in the documentation process.  It gathers together the content
   from various informal development documents, discussions, etc into a single place.  One or more Working
   Notes form the basic for the next step, which is one or more Standard/TechNote pairs.

1.1 Terminology

   “DCC” refers to NMRA DCC; “Legacy” refers to all pre-existing protocols including DCC, TMCC, Marklin,
   DCS, etc.

   “Trains”: For our purposes, Train is anything which can be independently controlled. In addition to a
   model of a prototype train from locomotive to caboose, it might be just single caboose, a set of lit &
   controlled passenger cars, a diesel MU lash up, or basically anything that can take an OpenLCB "decoder"
   or a DCC decoder with a legacy attachment.

   “Throttles”: For the purposes of discussion, we draw a distinction between three kinds of throttles that
   a user might encounter:

     * “Legacy Throttles” refers to throttles designed for use with extant DCC systems, e.g. a Digitrax
       DT402 or Lenz LH100.

     * “Full-Featured Throttles” refers to full-featured native OpenLCB throttles with multi-line color
       screens and effectively unlimited processing power, e.g. a software throttle implemented on an iPad.

     * “Simple Throttles” refers to throttles which are native OpenLCB nodes like Full-Featured Throttles,
       but which have more limited capabilities, e.g. no text display, a limited array of physical buttons,
       and constrained processing resources.

   “Proxies”: In the long term, we expect that OpenLCB protocols will go all the way to the train. This has
   great advantages, because you're always in complete communication with the train, and don't have to
   worry about only being able to configure the train when it's on a service track, storing information
   somewhere else so that it can be retrieved while the train is moving, etc. But until radio or other
   technologies mature to the point that this is possible, "proxy nodes" can be used as stand-ins for that
   capability. A throttle might communicate with a node that's serving as a proxy for the train, handling
   the communications, keeping track of status & configuration, etc. Out the back end of that proxy node is
   some other kind of communications, perhaps direct DCC or a connection to a legacy system that in turn
   makes DCC signals, or some other technology entirely. Due to the nature of those back side
   communications methods, the proxy may not be able to do everything that OpenLCB can, or only do some of
   it at certain times. The OpenLCB traction protocols need to take this reality into account.  Anther use
   case for proxies, discussed in detail below, is to provide the mechanism for consisting.

   “Command Stations”: Existing DCC and other control systems use “command stations” to create a track
   signal for controlling the trains. Usually the command station is controlled from the user side by some
   other network, to which throttles and other interface devices are connected. OpenLCB, it it's native
   form, has no such concept. Devices, like throttles, that want to talk to a train do so directly. Only
   when working with legacy systems does the concept of a command station enter, and usually through the
   form of a proxy node that is acting for the Train.

   “Consisting”: The running of multiple items together, e.g. three coupled engines, each with their own
   NodeID or DCC address, as a single locomotive. DCC systems provide this now in various ways and with
   various names.

1.2 Served Use Cases

  1.2.1 Train Operation

   Bill hasn't run his passenger train recently on his OpenLCB-equipped layout. He picks up a throttle,
   hits a few keys, sees his passenger train listed, selects it and starts to run it. Some configuration
   needs tweaking (e.g. volume too low), so he enters a configuration dialog on the throttle, finds the
   right item by reading through them, changes the value to be a few larger, and stores that back into the
   train as it's running on the main track. That makes it work immediately.

  1.2.2 Large Modular Layout

   Arnold has put his OpenLCB-equipped train on a large modular layout, where it is one of 500 pieces of
   equipment. He picks up a throttle, presses a few keys, sees his train, selects it and starts to operate
   it.

  1.2.3 Train on New Layout

   Jim takes his OpenLCB-equipped train to Bill's OpenLCB-equipped layout and puts it on the track. He
   picks up a throttle, hits a few keys, sees his train, selects it and starts to run it. On this layout,
   some configuration needs tweaking (e.g. volume too low), so he enters a configuration dialog on the
   throttle, finds the right item by reading through them, changes the value to be a few larger, and stores
   that back into the train. That makes it work. When he gets back home that value is still present so he
   changes it back using the same procedure.

  1.2.4 Legacy Train on New Layout

   Jim takes his DCC-equipped train to Bill's OpenLCB- and DCC-equipped layout and puts it on the track. He
   picks up a throttle, hits a few keys, sees his train, selects it and starts to run it.

   As an alternative, Jim takes his DCC-equipped locomotive to the layout, puts it on the track, enters the
   DCC address into a throttle, and starts to run it.

1.3 Unserved Use Cases

  1.3.1 Multiple Independent Command Stations

   Large modular layouts use multiple command stations to increase the effective bandwidth of the DCC bus.
    This is not an explicitly supported use case in the current work. Future work may make this possible as
   an extension.

  1.3.2 Improved Legacy Addressing

   DCC systems cannot run two locomotives with the same DCC address at the same time.  This will still be
   true when running DCC-equipped locomotives via OpenLCB protocols to the command station.

  1.3.3 Third-Party Communications

   Node A is a throttle that is controlling train node B.  Node C passively listens to the traffic and
   reacts to throttle commands and train status by taking various actions, such as providing appropriate
   sounds or preventing the speed from getting too high.

                                             2 Specified Sections

   This is the usual section organization for a Technical Note, to accumulate the Standard and Technical
   Note content in its eventual order.

2.1 Introduction

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

2.2 Intended Use

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

2.3 Reference and Context

   NMRA S9.2 and NMRA RP9.2.1 define the formats for DCC addresses

2.4 Message Formats

   AA.AA refers to an NMRA short or long address in the format defined by the NMRA. (Say a few words about
   short addresses in two bytes, maybe give examples)

  2.4.1 Defined Event IDs

    

   IsTrain: 01.01.00.00.00.00.03.03

   IsIdleProxy: 01.01.00.00.00.00.03.04

   IsInUseProxy: 01.01.00.00.00.00.03.05

   IsProxiedDccAddress: 06.01.00.CC.AA.AA.03.03

   EmergencyStopAll: 01.01.00.00.00.00.FF.FF

  2.4.2 Traction Control Command Message

   MTI: Priority 1, index 15, modifier 2, addressed => MTI 0x05EA, CAN frame [195EAsss] fd dd

   The MTI modifiers are chosen to have the reply a higher priority than the request, ensuring replies to
   repeated instructions are always possible.  The same priority and index are used for command and reply
   messages, changing only the modifier, to use less of the high-priority MTI space which is a scarce
   resource.

   This message type and MTI is specific to traction control.  The first byte of the content codes an
   “instruction”, which defines the rest of the format. The instruction codes were selected with the high
   nibble representing protocol (0x00 for OpenLCB full protocol; 0x80 for DCC legacy; others reserved)

   The Query Function Reply is in the format of the Set Function message, with a different MTI and the
   query bit set.

   Attach reply code:  Zero or not present, OK

   Detach reply code: Zero or not present, OK

   Do we want to return the number of attached nodes/DCC addresses?

   Error codes need to be defined.

     * Allocation Failed, temporary (try again) handles race conditions (but we need to look carefully at
       that race condition in practice:  With the current structure, does it end up adding two DCC
       addresses to the single proxy, instead of reserving it?  Probably need to separate out
       reservation-for-configuration. In general, two different things like “assign” and “reserve” should
       be handled by two separate things)

     * Allocation Failed, permanent (out of proxies, etc)

   Want to add responses to “Query attached Node IDs” and “Query attached DCC addresses”.  These have
   unbounded length if the number of members in a consist is not bounded by the protocol.  Could be a
   single large message, but everybody in the communication path still needs a maximum message size to
   ensure buffering.  So a multiple message (or multiple datagram) response with an “last one” bit is the
   way to go. Using datagrams is more protocol work, but leverages existing protocol support and moves the
   response to a lower priority.

   The Query Speed/Direction reply is almost in the Set Speed/Direction format, with the addition of the
   two additional speeds.  If a node cannot provide any of those three speeds, it should use float16 NaN
   (not a number) 0xFFFF. “Set Speed” is the most recent speed received in a Set Speed/Direction
   instruction.  “Commanded Speed” is the speed that the traction control is currently attempting to move,
   taking into account momentum and any other control modifiers.  “Actual Speed” is the current measured
   speed of the locomotive. There is no accuracy guarantee for Actual Speed.

   On CAN, the Query Speed/Direction reply does not fit in a single frame, so it's sent as two frames with
   start and end marked in the 1st data nibble (high part of destination address). The status byte was
   included so that the actual speed value would not be split across boundaries (though that's not
   necessarily guaranteed for other wire protocols that come along later) The status byte is reserved. Send
   0x00, don't check on receipt. For example, from node with alias 123 to node with alias 456, all speeds
   equal to 0x4420 would be sent as the two frames:

   195E8123 14 56 10 44 20 00 44 20

   195E8123 24 56 44 20

    

2.5 States

   Full OpenLCB nodes do not have any identified states for this protocol.  (They do remember their speed,
   direction and functions) Emergency stop is not a state.

   Proxy Node States:

     * Idle – not allocated to a specific legacy address

     * InUse – allocated to a specific legacy address and controlling the equipment (if any) at that
       address.

   The IsInUseProxy and IsIdleProxy Event IDs are used to indicate transitions in the state of a proxy
   node.  Proxy nodes are created in Idle state.

2.6 Interactions

   Emergency Stop

   Receipt of the Emergency Stop instruction stops the locomotive as fast as possible.  This sets the set
   speed to zero (preserving existing direction) and the commanded speed to zero (preserving existing
   direction) regardless of any momentum, BEMF or other operations with the train node.

   Emergency stop is not specific state.  The next Set Speed/Direction instruction will act immediately to
   change the set speed, and start the commanded speed and actual speed moving toward that set speed.

                                           3 Background Information

    

3.1 Proxies

  3.1.1 Lifecycle & Location

   Proxies have a lifecycle:

    1. They are created.  This might be when a physical node (the proxy or a physical node hosting a number
       of proxies within it) comes up, or they might be produced as needed.

    2. They get allocated to a particular legacy address

    3. They are used to operate the equipment at that legacy address. (Although this is optional, it's the
       whole point of having the proxy)

    4. They are deallocated.  (Items 2 through 4 are a loop, and can happen multiple times)

    5. Finally, they are destroyed. (This is optional; a proxy may stay around until the layout is powered
       off)

   So long as the proxy can do it's job, there's nothing that requires the proxy to be resident in the
   command station hardware.  It can be a separate board, in a computer somewhere that talks to
   pre-existing legacy equipment, or something else.  One way for OpenLCB vendors to support DCC is to put
   the proxies and a command station in a single unit, but that's not required.  Another approach would be
   an OpenLCB-compatible board that provides proxies, which then talk out through a LocoNet, XpressNet,
   TMCC or other connection to a legacy command station of a particular type.

   The simplest way to provide N proxies is to have N nodes appear when the layout turns on.  At any given
   instant, only one idle proxy is needed, so another approach would be to create them as needed. In this
   case, the newly created ones will get link access (e.g. go through the process of getting an alias on
   CAN), then announce their existence with an InitializationComplete message followed by
   ProducerIdentified and ConsumerIdentified messages as needed. Those can be used by Throttle nodes to
   track the NodeID of available proxies without having to query for one.  Note that this process needs to
   be very fast, so that multiple throttles needing to allocate proxies at the same time can reliably do
   it.

  3.1.2 Proxy Allocation

   Mostly about location of an Idle proxy.

    3.1.2.1 Collisions During Allocation

  3.1.3 Consisting

   Proxy can handle multiple node IDs (and/or DCC addresses), which allows implementation of consisting.
    Speed/direction just passes through; speed matching is automatic due to the use of scale meters/second
   for units.  

   It's up to the proxy how to handle pass-through of functions.  (Do we need to have a way to specify
   which of the included nodes IDs (and/or DCC addresses) are special, e.g. front or rear locomotive, in
   the setup?)

   It's up to the proxy how to handle pass-through of configuration read and/or writes.  Probably just
   don't allow them, or allow them only for configuration of the consist itself (e.g. how to do certain
   pass throughs)
