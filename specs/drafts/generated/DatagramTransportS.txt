                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This standard defines the protocol for transporting OpenLCB datagrams.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   The datagram transport protocol is intended to efficiently transfer small amounts (0-72 bytes) of data
   reliably between two OpenLCB nodes.  It allows for management of overlapping independent transmissions.

   The datagram transport protocol relies on the underlying OpenLCB message transport protocol for reliable
   sequenced communications.

   This document describes the required message formats for datagram transport. Section 4 gives an overview
   of the message types with an abstract numeric description intended as a normative guide to the
   construction of concrete message types over specific physical transport media. Section 7 describes, in
   concrete detail, the implementation of the datagram transport message formats for the specific physical
   transport media that have been adopted as normative standards.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   This is in the context of the following OpenLCB Standards:

     * The OpenLCB Message Network Standard, which defines the basic messages and how they interact.
       Higher-level protocols are based on this message network, but are defined elsewhere. The Message
       Network Standard defines the global error codes which are referenced here.

     * The OpenLCB CAN Frame Transfer Standard, which specifies the use and format of CAN frames for
       OpenLCB communications.

                                        4 Message Formats (Normative)

   In the following, the “Common MTI” column specifies the the MTI value to be used when communicating in
   OpenLCB common format. The Common MTI is an abstract numeric description intended as a normative guide
   to the construction of concrete message formats over specific physical transport media.   

4.1 Datagram Content

   Name             Simple Node Dest ID Event ID Common MTI Data Content 
   Datagram Content N           Y       N        0x1C48     0-72 bytes   

    

   The first byte of the data content defines the datagram type and is designated the Datagram Content ID.
   The values for that byte are documented in the Standard for the protocol that defines the type.

4.2 Datagram Received OK

    

   Name                 Simple Node Dest ID Event ID Common MTI Data Content   
   Datagram Received OK N           Y       N        0x0A28     Flags (1 byte) 

    

   The flag bits are defined as:

     * MSB 0x80 – Reply Pending – Use is defined by higher-level protocols.  

     * Low four bits 0x0F – Timeout Value – Zero indicates no timeout value. A value N of 0x01 through 0x0F
       indicates that the pending reply will be transmitted before 2N seconds have elapsed; if not, an
       error has occurred.

     * All others are reserved, shall be sent as zero and ignored upon receipt.

   Datagram Received OK messages without a Flags byte shall be treated as if they contained a byte with a
   zero value.

4.3 Datagram Rejected

   Name              Simple Node Dest ID Event ID Common MTI Data Content 
                                                             Error Code   
   Datagram Rejected N           Y       N        0x0A48                  
                                                             (2 bytes)    

    

   Nodes shall accept and process Datagram Rejected messages that do not contain the full error code.
   Missing error code bits are to be interpreted as zero.

  4.3.1 Error Codes

   The Error Code field is two bytes and shall use the codes defined in the OpenLCB Message Network
   Standard.

   Nodes may, but are not required to, use 0-3 of the error code field to define specific error codes in
   concert with the flag bits defined above.

                                             5 States (Normative)

   The common OpenLCB datagram protocol has no formal states.

                                          6 Interactions (Normative)

   A node that receives a valid Datagram Content message shall send either a Datagram Received OK or
   Datagram Rejected message in reply. A node that receives a Datagram Content message that does not comply
   with this Standard may, but is not required to, reply with a Datagram Rejected message.

6.1 Normal Transmission

   Normal transmission consists of the transmitting node sending a Datagram Content message to the
   receiving node, followed by the receiving node sending a Datagram Received OK message to the
   transmitting node.  A node must not send a send a second Datagram, to the same receiving node, before
   receiving a reply from the receiving node.  

6.2 Rejected Transmission

   After the transmitting node sends a Datagram Content message to the receiving node, the receiving node
   may send a Datagram Rejected message to the transmitting node.

    

   Upon receipt of a Datagram Rejected message with  a Temporary Error, the original transmitting node may
   resend the same Datagram Content message, or may abandon the transmission attempt.

   Upon receipt of a Datagram Rejected message with a Permanent Error, the original transmitting node shall
   abandon the transmission attempt and not resend the original Datagram Content message.

                                  7 Adaptation to CAN Transport (Normative)

   This section describes the CAN implementation of the datagram transport message formats.

7.1 CAN Message Formats

   The OpenLCB CAN Frame Transport Standard and OpenLCB Message Network Standard define how OpenLCB
   messages are carried across CAN networks. Following those standards, the Datagram Transport messages
   used on CAN are as defined in the following table.

   Name                 CAN-MTI Can Header             Data Content       
                                0x1Add,dsss2 – Single3                    
                                                       
                                0x1Bdd,dsss – First    
   Datagram Content     0xddd1                         0–8 bytes
                                0x1Cdd,dsss – Middle   
                                                       
                                0x1Ddd,dsss – Last     
   Datagram Received OK 0xA28   0x19A2,8sss            0xfddd4, Flags     
   Datagram Rejected    0xA48   0x19A4,8sss            0xfddd, Error Code 

    

7.2 CAN States

   A node implementing the OpenLCB-CAN datagram protocol shall maintain a Datagram-started state for each
   datagram that it is receiving as a sequence of frames. If the node receives multiple overlapping
   datagrams, the states shall be independent.

7.3 CAN Interactions

  7.3.1 Normal Transmission

   Normal transmission of a datagram over CAN consists of the transmitting node sending the Datagram
   Content message using one of two sequences of Datagram frames:

     * One Datagram Content Single Frame

     * One Datagram Content First Frame, followed by zero or more Datagram Content Middle Frame, followed
       by one Datagram Content Last Frame

   A node shall not interleave transmission of frames from more than one datagram to the same target node.
   A node shall not transmit frames with lower CAN priority between the frames making up a datagram.  A
   node may, but is not required to, transmit frames with higher CAN priority between the frames making up
   a datagram.

   A receiving node receiving either of the above sequences shall send either a Datagram Received OK or
   Datagram Rejected message in reply.

  7.3.2 Rejected Transmission

   If a receiving node receives a sequence of Datagram frames other than one of

     * One Datagram Content Single Frame

     * One Datagram Content First Frame, followed by zero or more Datagram Content Middle Frame, followed
       by one Datagram Content Last Frame5

   the receiving node shall send a Datagram Rejected message with a Temporary Error, indicating a resend is
   allowed.

   1 ddd – The 12-bit destination alias field

   2 sss – The 12-bit source alias field

   3 Because CAN frames are limited to 8 bytes, datagrams larger than 8 bytes must be broken up among
   multiple messages. Thus, four distinct message types are defined to aid in flow control.

   4 fddd — First two bytes of the data-part, representing the 4-bit flag field and 12-bit destination
   Alias. See the OpenLCB-CAN Frame Transport Standard.

   5 The total payload bytes sent, including any First, Middle, and Last Frames, cannot exceed 72 bytes.
