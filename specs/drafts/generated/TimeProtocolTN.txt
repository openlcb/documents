                                                1 Introduction

   Model railroad layouts sometime have their own time displayed via visible clocks that people refer to
   when operating the layout.  These might display a different time of day from the current real clock
   time, so that an evening train can be run during the day.  They might run at a different rate, so that
   the shorter distances of the model are covered by a train in the right number of “fast minutes”.

   Layouts that have multiple clock faces might want to synchronize them by running them from a single time
   generator.  OpenLCB should provide a way to do that over existing OpenLCB infrastructure.

   Producer/Consumer events, one per second or minute, could certainly meet this need.  Since event IDs are
   arbitrary, in the absence of any other support, the clocks would have to have 24*60 or 24*60*60 separate
   event IDs configured between clock time producers and consumers.  This is untenable.  Hence, the primary
   reason for this Standard is to create well-defined ranges of event IDs that can be used to represent
   time for driving clock displays.

   A secondary purpose is to allow producers on the layout to control the clock operation by producing
   certain events.

   A tertiary purpose is to allow other consumers on the layout to be controlled via the time signal by
   interpreting the events or event ranges specified here.  Not all timing-related purposes will be met by
   the contents of this Standard, and other ways of handling timing formation may be defined in the future.

1.1 Served use cases

   Fast clocks distributed around the layout all show the fast time. They start and stop together. Start
   and stop controls are distributed around the layout. The rate can be varied as needed. The display
   includes a modeled date.

   In addition to fast time, a “correct wall-clock time” can also be distributed around the layout room.
   Further, a “duration so far” time is distributed around the layout.  It starts and stops independently
   of the fast clock.

   A node connected to model building lights turns them on and off at specific fast-clock times. A control
   for lights or ventilation can turn it on and off at specific wall-clock times.

   Time acts in multiple ways:

     * Action at a specific time: “The bell rings at noon”

     * Condition during an interval: “The porch light should be on from 5PM to midnight”

     * As a state: “The clock shows 10:15AM”

   Model building lights and layout room lights turn on and off in a fast cycle to simulate a day every 10
   minutes.

   The model railroad can run through a scenario:  Start at 17:00 (5PM) and run to 20:00 (8PM), then go
   back to 17:00 and repeat.

   A town contains 100 separate lights, each connected to an output pin on OpenLCB nodes. They turn on and
   off on a detailed cycle.

   Simple nodes should be able to respond to timed events without any additional cost.

   Modular layout sections developed and configured in separate locations can be brought together and
   operated without prior management/allocation of magic numbers, and with only minimal (at most one node
   and one operation) reconfiguration.

1.2 Unserved use cases

   This Standard does not completely solve the use cases in this section.

   The model building lights turn on and off only a few seconds apart: this proposal is for
   minute-granularity timing.  Faster timing can be controlled from the node using a script that gets its
   initial trigger from the fast clock signal, or some other node can produce closely-timed events that are
   consumed to drive the lights.

   Rapidly moving from one time to another, e.g from 20:00 back to 17:00 in the use case above, can be done
   in several ways, none of which cover all needs:

     * By rapidly stepping through the intervening minutes.  This will ensure that e.g. a light that turns
       on at 14:00 and off at 18:00 will properly be on when the sequence restarts at 17:00.  But it will
       also cause the church bell that's scheduled to strike at 08:00 and 12:00 to ring between “20:00” and
       “17:00”.

     * By going directly to 17:00.  This will skip ringing the church bells in the point above, but might
       not get the state at 17:00 correct. The state can be addressed by optionally producing the necessary
       events as part of going directly, but it's not possible to automatically which events are consumed
       for state changes (light on), and which for instantaneous occurrences (toll bell).

   Layout lights execute a pattern that's different when the modeled day is Monday vs Saturday: Day of
   week, or calendar date in general, does not result in different events being produced.  This use case
   should be solved the regular producer-consumer techniques and a smarter scheduler to produce the
   appropriate events.

                                        2 Annotations to the Standard

2.1 Introduction

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

   Clock events are produced by a clock generator, and consumed by clock faces and other devices that want
   information about time. The events themselves are called “clock events”, as they carry information about
   the current clock time.

2.2 Intended Use

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

2.3 Reference and Context

   This specification is in the context of the following OpenLCB-CAN Standards:

     * OpenLCB Event Transport Standard, which defines messages for transporting Event IDs and identifying
       producers and consumers.

     * The OpenLCB Event Identifiers Standard, which defines the format and content of Event IDs including
       the class of Well-Known Event IDs and Automatically-Routed Event IDs.

     * OpenLCB Unique Identifiers Standard, which defines the allocation of OpenLCB 48-bit unique
       identifiers

   For more information on format and presentation, see:

     * OpenLCB Common Information Technical Note

2.4 Message Formats

   The “Specific Upper Parts” can be separated into well-known “public” Identifiers, and self-allocated
   “private” Identifiers.

   The “Default Fast Clock”, “Default Real-Time Clock”, “Alternate Clock 1”, and “Alternate Clock 2” terms
   are not further defined in the Standard.  They have no operational effect. They're provided to make it
   easier for a clock face manufacturer to set up the clock face node to automatically find the default
   fast clock generator, without user involvement, when attached to an OpenLCB installation.  One fast
   clock system is expected to be the most common installation, and this makes it very convenient for the
   user.

   The values are packed into two bytes to make it easier to allocate the unique “Specific Upper Part” by
   using an OpenLCB unique ID.

  2.4.1 Report Time Event ID

  2.4.2 Report Date Event ID

  2.4.3 Report Year Event ID

    

  2.4.4 Report Rate Event ID

   A rate of zero is means the clock is stopped, though it is preferred to use the Stop/Start Events for
   starting and stopping the clock

  2.4.5 Report Intermediate Time Event ID

   This event allows immediate reporting of the current time to the minute resolution while allowing nodes
   that track time at a finer resolution than minutes to optionally ignore the intermediate time reported
   as a cue to reset its internal sub-minute resolution counter to zero.

  2.4.6 Set Time Event ID

  2.4.7 Set Date Event ID

  2.4.8 Set Year Event ID

  2.4.9 Set Rate Event ID

   A rate of zero is means the clock is stopped, though it is preferred to the Stop/Start Events for
   starting and stopping the clock

  2.4.10 Latch Settings Event ID

   This event allows the setting of the Rate, Year, Date, and Time as an atomic operation.

  2.4.11 Stop/Start Event ID

   Having a separate start/stop mechanism, instead of just setting rate to zero, makes distributed
   start/stop control easier. There's no need for everybody to remember the current rate while the clock is
   stopped.

  2.4.12 Undefined/Reserved Event ID’s

   Any Event ID’s not explicitly defined by the standard are reserved for future use.

2.5 States

   The “independent” in the definition of states means that clock generators work independently of each
   other, and don't have linked states.

   It's up to the node implementor to decide how to implement the internal clock time. It could be an
   internal time generator of some kind, or linked to some external time reference.

2.6 Interactions

   Note that nodes should not assume that they will receive any time event only once.  As time is set, it's
   possible for a node to receive the current time more than once.

   Note that the time is only advertised with minute granularity.  If a Set Time is received when the
   current clock is 20 seconds past the minute, setting the time will set the time to exactly the minute
   received, with no seconds value taken into account.

   It is not expected that it will be routine for clock generators to refuse to set their time, nor that
   other nodes will attempt to set it when not allowed to. The Standard is silent as to whether the seconds
   counter inside the clock should be reset to zero at this point. However, it can be implied that a Report
   Time Event is sent when the seconds count is equal to zero and an Report Intermediate Time Event is sent
   when the seconds count is not equal to zero.

     * Not resetting it allows time to move continuously.  Nodes have to understand that the time they
       receive is just to the nearest minute, and not infer that the seconds value associated with a Report
       Time event will always be zero.

     * Resetting it allows other nodes to assume that the seconds value associated with a Report Time event
       is always zero, at the cost of preventing time from being exactly 60 seconds to a minute always.

   In general, fast clocks don't always have 60 seconds to the minute in any case, and the next routine
   time announcement will be at a zero-seconds count, so neither of these is a critical issue and both are
   allowed.  It's recommended that clocks set when they receive a Set Time event, and that nodes not send
   one unless the network has been configured to allow it.

   OpenLCB doesn't have latency guarantees, so different nodes may have slightly different ideas of the
   time. In practice, the differences should be much less than a second for operating OpenLCB
   installations. It is allowable, though not required, for a clock consumer to perform an average on any
   observed jitter of of the incoming Report Time Events such that it can factor out that jitter on the
   node’s internal tracking of the passage of time.

   Clock generators may also set their time in response to other events, not specified here.  For example,
   to allow slaving of a clock generators events to time events from another clock generator, a clock
   generator may react to time event IDs with another high six byte Specific Upper Part.  How, when,
   whether to do that is an internal configuration option of the clock generator node, and is not discussed
   by the Standard.

  2.6.1 Startup

   As stated in section 3.5 below, there are use cases, such as a clock face display, where a node will be
   consuming either all or the vast majority of clock events.  In this case, it is preferable to use the
   Consumer Range Identified message in order to announce consumption of clock events.

   There is another use case where a node may only be consuming a single or few clock events.  In this
   case, it is preferable to use the Consumer Identified message to announce consumption of clock events.
    Some clock event consumers do not know anything clock events, or make any distinction between clock
   events and other event non-clock events. From their point of view, they are generic event consumers

    2.6.1.1 Clock Generator

   This sequence is required such that a clock consumer that uses Rate, Year, and/or Date as a factor in
   establishing its internal meaning of time can synchronize itself atomically across a change or
   progression of time that includes Rate, Year, and/or Date.

  2.6.2 Clock Report

   The reason to limit the Report Time Event generation to once per real world minute is not only motivated
   by conserving bandwidth.  If we consider the fasted clock rate of 511.75:1, this would result well over
   50% of the total bandwidth available to a CAN bus segment being used up.  If we consider a more
   practically realistic clock rate of 12:1, the resulting bandwidth used becomes less than 3%.  Rather,
   the motivation behind limiting the Report Time Event generation is to prevent adding too much clutter in
   bus capture logs.  One Report Time Event sent once per real minute results in a total bandwidth
   utilization of less than 0.5%.

   It is important to note that, unless following one of the noted exceptions, a clock generator is not
   required to produce any clock events for which a clock event consumer has not been identified.

   The process for a clock generator to identify all the clock event consumers is not explicitly specified.
    Two possible options include:

    1. Send an Identify Events Addressed message to each node in the network as described in section Error:
       Reference source not found Error: Reference source not found.

    2. Send an Identify Events Global message.

  2.6.3 Clock Set

   A race condition is possible between two nodes simultaneously requesting to adjust the Rate, Year, Date,
   and/or Time of a clock. The standard makes no prescribed attempt to mitigate this race condition. It is
   possible, though not required, that a clock generator ignore a configuration attempt from a node when an
   outstanding attempt, pending a Latch Settings Event, is already in progress by another node.

    

                                           3 Background Information

   This section is general information of interest to the reader, implementers, etc...

3.1 Multiple Clocks

   A user might want multiple clocks, for example a real-time clock display to show current time, and a
   fast clock display to show railroad time.

   The protocol provides for this via multiple clock generators with unique upper parts in their event IDs,
   but it's up to the user to allocate clock generators and configure the clock producers and consumers to
   use the proper clock number as part of their event range.

   Multiple clock generators using the same event ID range will not function properly. The source node IDs
   in the Producer-Consumer Event Report messages produced by the multiple clocks can help diagnose and
   correct this.

3.2 Jumps in Time

   Through configuration, it is possible that a clock generator would make a large jump, forward or
   backward, in time from its previous set time.  The only requirement about this jump is that the sequence
   described in section 2.6.1.1 above follows the jump.

   It is allowable, though not required, for a a clock generator to produce intermediate Report Time
   Events, as well as Report Year and Date events, at a highly accelerated rate. One possible use case for
   this is to “reset” time for node that consume clock events but otherwise have no knowledge of the
   concept of time. If either of these, or similar, techniques are deployed, the sequenced described in
   section 2.6.1.1 above is still required once the application of the technique is complete and the new
   set time is reached.

   It is not prescribed how this might occur, but one can imagine a number of different scenarios:

    1. Generic event consumers are setup to turn on/off lights at certain time throughout a simulated day.
        The end of an operating session occurs asynchronous to a full cycle.  The operator wants to reset
       time to the beginning of the day for the next session.  In order to reset the interactions, the
       clock generator replays the new set time’s previous 24-hours in the form of events before settling
       on the new time.

    2. A jump forward in time occurs.  In order for generic event consumers to progress their state to this
       new time, intermediate clock events are sent at an accelerated rate until the new set time is
       reached.

3.3 Configuration via a simple teach-learn UI

   Blue and Gold configuration does not have to be implemented, perhaps many devices won't, but important
   to show it can be done. Configuring consumers to react to a particular time event can be done by putting
   a programming button on the master time producer that sends the learn message for the current clock
   time.

   For Example:

   To Teach: gold; blue to select: hour, minute, rate; up/down to change; gold

   To nominate: blue, blue; gold to select: h,m,r; up/down; blue

   Better (more powerful) UIs can then use the same underlying teach/learn implementation.

3.4 Alarms

   Early OpenLCB clock prototypes contained support for “Alarms”, special events that could be configured
   to be produced at a specific time.  By configuring consumers to listen for the alarm event, instead of a
   particular time, it becomes easier to reconfigure the start or stop time for layout activities:  Change
   one thing, the association between producing the alarm event and the time that it happens, and all the
   other nodes will follow without reconfiguration. This method is also sometimes called “cueing”.

   This protocol does not contain any specific support for alarms or cueing, because it doesn't need to.
    Simplicity is important, and the production of alarms can proceed completely independently. Any event
   ID could be produced by any node, upon receipt of the particular time event, and the details of that
   doesn't have to be part of this protocol. An alarm-producer isn't specifically part of the clock
   producer. It could be anywhere.  And no protocol needs to be defined for alarm events, as they're just
   regular produced events: When event A is  consumed, produce B and C.  That's a generally-useful thing to
   have, even for non-time events.

3.5 Low-Bandwidth Clock Producers

   The Standard specifies that only time events with consumers need to be produced.  Clock-producing nodes
   can use this to reduce the bandwidth used by the clock events, particularly at high rate.  The producing
   node can automatically maintain a list of consumed event IDs, and produce only those.

   Once the clock-producing node is up and running, it can listen for Consumer Identified and Consumer
   Range Identified messages and include any Report Time Events seen in its list. Nodes that newly attach
   or restart will emit these automatically.  So long as the clock-producing node isn't marked as a Simple
   node, these will be forwarded to it.

   The process to find all consumers when the clock-producing node becomes active on an already existing
   OpenLCB network is similar, it just involves querying the entire network:

     * Send a Verify Node Global, and construct a list of nodes from the response

     * At a suitably metered interval, send an Identify Event Adressedto each node.

     * Construct the list of consumed event IDs from the response.

   There is currently no support to do a network-parallel query such as “Identify All Consumers of Event
   IDs in the following Range” due to buffer-management and network-load-scaling issues with it.

3.6 Slaving Clock Generators

   For some modular layout use cases (still being identified), it's useful to have the time events be
   created synchronous with a local modular clock generator.  For example, a modular segment has a clock
   generator and multiple nodes that are configured to together do complex automation.  You want to include
   it in a larger modular layout without having to reconfigure this.  

   One way to do that is to slave the modular clock generator to another master clock generator, so that
   the master clock generator controls and specifies the time, and the modular clock generator produces its
   own events to represent that time.  The consuming nodes then act on the modular clock events they are
   configured with.

   Operationally, this slaving consists of reissuing the events with a different “Specific Upper Part”,
   translating the “Specific Upper Part” from the master clock generator's values to the slaved modular
   clock generator's values.

   Mechanically, this can be done by having a mode in the clock generator node that does this, having a
   gateway onto the modular OpenLCB segment that does the translation (and removing the original modular
   clock generator), using a node that can do alarms/cueing for the needed events, or some other mechanism.
    The standard is about protocol, not implementation, and so is silent about this.

   If a modular clock generator is to be configured to follow some other clock event range, that raises the
   question of how to do it.  The Standard is silent about this too, but it's important that there be a way
   to do it within the Standard.  Choices include:

     * Configure it via the memory configuration protocol to listen for a particular value of the top
       bytes.

     * Many layouts just have one clock generator. If that's true, a button on the clock that says “Slave
       to master” will get the right one. If there's more than one, pushing that button could just go to
       the next one.

     * Use teach/learn or blue/gold to teach an event from the master clock, or some producer or consumer
       of the master clock, to the slave.  For example, if there's a master “clock stop” button, teach that
       to the slave so that it knows that's the range to listen to.  This can be done even if there are
       multiple clocks operating on the layout.

3.7 History and Numerology

   There are slightly more than 216 seconds in a day, and just less than 211 minutes. A 17-bit “seconds
   since midnight” format could be used, but it would still take three bytes, and is somewhat harder to
   read and display. It would keep the non-used code points together, perhaps better for expansion, but
   it's not clear how much time is going to expand.

   By-seconds events allow much more precise timing, particularly at low fast-clock multipliers (clocks
   near real-time), but they result in too much traffic at high fast-clock multipliers (really fast
   clocks).  A 10 minute fast 24 hour cycle is 144 messages per second, more than 15% of CAN bandwidth.
   Even faster rates, for example to do a fast recycle to prepare for a new sequence, would clearly
   saturate the bus.  Sparse clocks would help with this, but are significantly more complex for the clock
   generator, which may need a lot of event storage to keep rates low. This has led to the choice of minute
   events, with seconds reserved for possible future consideration.

   Commands to change the run/stop state and clock rate are broadcast as separate events. That's better
   than coding them in the time events themselves, because if e.g. rate was separate bits in the event,
   simple nodes could not be configured to recognize specific times of the day.

   Regardless of whether the clock sends seconds or minutes, small times can be maintained via a local
   timebase synchronized to the time broadcast and the rate messages.  There's a limit to how precise this
   can be, but it is probably worth a factor of 10 and perhaps 100 in resolution.

                                                4 Future Work

   The existence of this Simple Time Protocol does not preclude the existence of other protocols for the
   conveyance of time.  It is possible that that future time related protocols could be developed in the
   future in order to realize the unserved use cases identified in section 1.2 above.
