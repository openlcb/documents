                                                1 Introduction

   This explanatory note contains informative discussion and background for the corresponding “OpenLCB-TCP
   Segment Transfer Standard”. This explanation is not normative in any way.

   This section describes carrying OpenLCB™ across a transport mechanism that is reliable (all bytes are
   guaranteed to arrive in their original order) and can carry binary bytes.

   Examples of this include:

     * TCP/IP point-to-point links

     * High-bandwidth wireless links

     * Program-to-program links within computers

   Reliable binary links can carry the full OpenLCB protocol. Messages are carried in full common format.

   The reliable binary wire protocol is meant to attach multiple segments of the entire OpenLCB instance.
   Using this protocol, messages can be moved from one gateway to another, where one or more additional
   OpenLCB nodes can be reached through the gateway(s).

   It is meant for applications from attaching a single remote console to interconnecting large modular
   layouts totaling 500 or more segments and 10's of thousands of devices. As such, it must have no
   addressing limitations beyond those built into the OpenLCB common message format and node serial number
   format.

   This wire protocol makes no assumptions about the available bandwidth. In particular, it must work, with
   perhaps limited effectiveness, when the link bandwidth is small compared to the capacity on the other
   side of the gateways.

   No assumption is made that this wire protocol is being used over point-to-point connections. Broadcast
   and multicast connections between nodes via this protocol are also permitted.

                                        2 Annotations to the Standard

   This section provides background information on corresponding sections of the Standard document. It's
   expected that two documents will be read together.

2.1 Introduction

2.2 References and Context

2.3 Message Format

   The various reserved bits are allocated to preserve options for future expansion.  New distinct types,
   that don't overlap with the existing types, can use the “check for zero” bits.  New modifier codes are
   more likely, so more bits are reserved where existing implementations just ignore their content.

   Flags field:

   The LSB 0x0001 is an expansion flag used to (eventually) add link control messages. These might be
   needed for e.g. turning gateway-filtering on and off, loading/resetting remote diagnostic information,
   etc.

   The 0x0002 bit indicates “chaining”: Another prefix is next, before the body of the message.

   The 0x0020 and 0x0010 bits provide a way of extending a single OpenLCB message across multiple TCP
   transfers.  (Note that the terminology here is confusing, and should probably be clarified).  This might
   be used to e.g. simplify buffering and framing in CAN-Ethernet gateways.  A single OpenLCB message that
   extends across multiple CAN frames is best accumulated into a single TCP transmission.  If that's not
   possible due to buffering or other issues, it can be sent as multiple TCP transmissions using the 0x0020
   and 0x0010 bits. The 0x0020 bit when 0 means “start or only part”; the 0x0010 bit when 0 means “end or
   only part”. The 0-based coding was selected to improve human-readability of messages, as most messages
   are expected to be “only”.

   The length code is put early to make it easier to parse messages of future, unknown format.  But this
   doesn't make it easier to skip new prefixes of unknown length.  Should there be an additional prefix
   length field, so new prefix formats can be skipped easily?

2.4 States

   We don't have a “link up” state in OpenLCB itself, just in the link implementation. Is one needed? Might
   enter e.g. routing. If it existed, we could define link-specific messages to check the status.

  2.4.1 Multiple-part Messages

2.5 Interactions

   The chaining process is meant to provide a bread-crumb path back through the network. OpenLCB networks
   are not meant to have very complicated routing structures, so that only a few prefixes will get added to
   the average message.

   Development of link-specific messages and interactions

3.1 Monitoring of other protocols

   There's a need to be able to pass non-common OpenLCB messages over binary links. For example, a
   CAN-Ethernet bridge may want to pass CAN frames through to the Ethernet unchanged for monitoring
   purposes. This includes both the CAN frame(s) that correspond to OpenLCB common messages, and also other
   frames that are used for alias reservation, etc.

3.2 Gateway-Gateway Messages

   The TCP/IP gateway to gateway links effectively partition the overall OpenLCB into smaller "segments".
   OpenLCB nodes in any of these must be able to communicate with each other via any OpenLCB common
   message, including over intermediate wire-protocols that differ.

   Gateway-to-gateway messages (will be) defined for control operations to make this communication
   transparent. These messages are used to carry information between gateways on a link, and do not
   propagate beyond that.

   Control of gateway nodes is done via direct messages to those nodes.

   Note that these are not available on e.g. CAN links.

   Possible uses:

     * Redirecting point-to-point links: “I'm going offline now, you should connect to him”

     * Negotiating buffer sizes and traffic levels; flow control.

   Control messages to individual nodes, not gateway-gateway communication, will be used for:

     * Turning filtering on and off in gateways so that all messages can be forwarded

     * Turning gateway message logging on and off

     * Retrieving status and history information

3.3 Rendezvous & Self-Configuration Method

   (Some or all of this needs to move to the Standard)

   In the following, “node” means an OpenLCB node with a native TCP connection. This node might be e.g. a
   gateway to an entire CAN segment, but that doesn't matter to this discussion.

   Two types of connections could be provided: “point-to-point” and “hub-and-spoke”.

   In “point-to-point”, two nodes are connected by a direct TCP connection. This works fine for e.g. two
   nodes, but using only point-to-point connections doesn't scale well. If there are 10 nodes present, each
   has to maintain 9 TCP sessions, which is rapidly becoming impractical. On the other hand, it's the
   simplest possible TCP code.

   In the “hub-and-spoke” connection, one node acts as a “hub” and all others connect to it as “spokes”.
   Each spoke node sends traffic to the hub, and the hub then forwards it to the N-2 other nodes.

  3.3.1 Protocol

   When a node comes up, it enquires for a “_openlcb-hub._tcp.local.” service. If found, connect to it.

   If not found, and if the node can be a hub (it's not required that all nodes be able to do that), it
   configures itself to act as a hub and advertises the “_openlcb-hub._tcp.local.” service. Since all that
   takes time, it then checks again for another node advertising to be a hub. If found, it drops back to
   connecting to that and removes its service if the connection succeeds.

   If all that fails, start advertising as “_openlcb-node._tcp.local.”. Then, check for any other node(s)
   advertising as “_openlcb-node._tcp.local.” and connect to as many as possible of the ones that are
   found.

                               4 Relationship with Native-Ethernet Connections

   Imagine you have five OpenLCB CAN segments, connected by small boxes to an Ethernet: You can use an
   Ethernet-specific protocol (e.g. ala Ethertalk, etc), or you can use IP connections (probably TCP/IP).

   The TCP/IP solution seems to require more overhead, but it works about the same on a single Ethernet
   segment and across multiple segments, wide area links, etc.

   The Ethernet-protocol solution seems somewhat simpler (though getting a protocol certified is a lot of
   work), but can't get traffic off the local Ethernet segment. It spans hubs, but not switches, and would
   require another protocol for OpenLCB-specific devices to connect to the larger Internet. So although an
   Ethernet-specific protocol seems simpler to create, in practice you'd still need to create Ethernet to
   Internet routers, resulting in an overall increase in engineering effort.

   Where Ethernet-specific protocol might be useful is in reducing the configuration load for
   single-segment implementations. It would be nice if people could plug e.g. five OpenLCB CAN-Ethernet
   adapters into a single Ethernet and have them find and configure themselves to interconnect. This
   doesn't require new OpenLCB-specific protocols; it's much more likely that a robust solution could be
   created using e.g. Bonjour (a form of ZeroConf) and similar standard protocols. Some recommendations
   here would improve interoperability of implementing devices.

4.1 CAN-ASCII Formatted Protocol

   We have also used a protocol where GridConnect-format CAN frames are directly sent back and forth to an
   Arduino node, which places them on the CAN bus. This is essentially an Ethernet-CAN replacement for the
   popular USB-CAN adapters. These advertise themselves as “_openlcb-can._tcp.” protocol, by convention on
   port 12021.
