                                                1 Introduction

   This Technical Note contains informative discussion and background for the corresponding “OpenLCB
   Datagram Transport Standard”. This explanation is not normative in any way.

   Some wire protocols can support only very short packets/frames, e.g. CAN with a limited header and data
   payload. OpenLCB needs to be able to move larger chunks of data than that. OpenLCB streaming provides a
   very large payload, at some cost in setup time and complexity. “Datagrams” move an amount of data
   in-between “small enough to always be atomic” and “large enough to justify streaming overhead”.

   The datagram protocol on CAN links uses the same structure as the common protocol, except for the need
   to split the message into frames.

   A node may only send one datagram at a time to any given destination node. A node may interleave
   transmission of datagrams to separate nodes, but this is not recommended because the longer transmission
   window increases the probability of buffer collisions in recipient nodes.

                                        2 Annotations to the Standard

   This section provides background information on corresponding sections of the Standard document. It is
   expected that two documents will be read together.

2.4  Message Formats

  2.4.1 Datagram Content

   The datagram length is coded by the transport medium:  There is no separate length field in the datagram
   content itself.

   Note that zero-length datagrams are valid.

    

  2.4.2 Datagram Received OK

   This is an addressed message. The destination address (full Node ID or alias) can be taken directly from
   the received Datagram Content message.

  2.4.3 Datagram Rejected

   This is an addressed message. The destination address (full Node ID or alias) can be taken directly from
   the received Datagram Content message.

   Rejecting datagrams is meant for cases where the actual transmission and reception of the datagram has
   failed.  It's not meant for higher level errors, such as “The command to move the points did not succeed
   because they were stuck”. The decision whether to reply with Datagram Received OK or Datagram Rejected
   needs to be made promptly, so that the reply can be sent, buffers can be cleared and communications can
   continue.

    2.4.3.1 Error Codes

   “Permanent error” — This node does not process datagrams, will not accept a datagram from this source,
   or for some other reason will not ever be able to accept this particular datagram. The datagram should
   not be retransmitted.

   “Resend OK” — In contrast to the error above, the problem accepting the datagram is of a transient
   nature, and the sending node should attempt retransmission at its discretion at some point in the
   immediate to near future.

   “Transport Error” — Something appears to have gone wrong between the sender and the recipient, perhaps
   because the recipient received datagram fragments out of order, or a sequence of datagrams was received
   out of order (at the application layer). This error flag does not by itself imply that the sender should
   retransmit; rather, this flag should be combined with the “Resend OK” flag to explicitly request
   retransmission.

   Optionally, the node can mark the reply with one or more of several conditions:

   “Source not permitted” — Datagrams from this source will never be accepted. Generally, this flag is only
   meaningful in conjunction with the “Permanent Error” flag, as there is no sense is retransmission in
   this context. This flag might be used to indicate that a receiving node is only willing to establish a
   connection with an exclusive set of nodes.

   “Datagrams not accepted” — This node will not accept datagrams under any circumstance. A node can also
   reject the interaction with an Optional Interaction Rejected message (see “OpenLCB Message Network
   Standard”) instead of sending Datagram Rejected with this code.

2.5 States (Normative)

   A datagram receive buffer is a form of state information, in that it's either full with a message being
   processed, or empty and ready to accept a new datagram.  The protocols are written so that
   implementations can use just one buffer, or many.  Depending on the connection to the physical OpenLCB
   network being used, it may be possible for overlapping reception of datagrams.  This works even with one
   buffer, because datagrams that arrive while the first is still in process can be rejected temporarily.
   More buffers can make that more efficient.

2.6 Interactions (Normative)

  2.6.1 Normal Transmission

   A datagram is just a single message containing the Datagram MTI and the data byte(s). There is a
   convention for a data format indicator at the start of the data bytes for use with application layer
   protocols transported over datagrams, see §3.4 below.

   Once the datagram has been successfully received, the receiving node replies to the original source node
   with a “Datagram Received OK” message. Note that the node is not required to examine or process the
   datagram before replying; execution errors that happen later must be signaled using another protocol.

  2.6.2 Rejected Transmission

   Instead of “Datagram Received OK”, the receiving node may return a “Datagram Rejected” message with an
   error code that represents the reason(s) and possible reaction(s).

    

2.7 Implementation via CAN Transport

  2.7.1 CAN Message Formats

   For CAN, the Datagram Content message is broken into a First frame, one or more Middle frames, and a
   Last frame.  In the degenerate case of a very short message that can fit into one frame, there is also
   an Only frame.  These are described in more detail below.  The CAN header values are chosen to prevent
   CAN priority from reordering frames in a way that would damage the transmission.

   CAN-Datagram Content Single Frame — Note that zero-length datagrams are valid.

   CAN-Datagram Content First Frame — Note that there's no requirement that this contain 8 bytes.

   CAN-Datagram Content Middle Frame — Note that there's no requirement that this contain 8 bytes. It
   cannot be empty, though.

   CAN Datagram Content Last Frame — Note that this frame can be zero length.

  2.7.2 CAN States

   The CAN implementation allows more than one datagram to arrive at a node at the same time, since
   datagram fragments from node A and node B can arrive interleaved at their destination node C.  Datagram
   implementations need to track this in their internal state.  Approaches include:

     * Having a single buffer, in which the fragments that go with the first-received Datagram Content
       First Frame are accumulated.  Other datagrams can then be rejected immediately when their Datagram
       Content First Frame or Datagram Content Single Frame arrive.  

     * Having multiple buffers in which the datagrams are separately accumulated.

   Any implementation that obeys the protocol constraints in the Standard is acceptable.

  2.7.3 CAN Interactions

    2.7.3.1 Normal Transmission

   The sender breaks the datagram content into one or more frames. The source NodeID alias and destination
   NodeID alias are, unlike other addressed messages, both contained in the header. Format indicators are
   used to mark the segmentation into frames. The data part of the CAN frame can carry from zero to eight
   data bytes.

   If there are more than eight bytes to the datagram, the rest are sent as consecutive frames. Because CAN
   transmission retains frame order between sender and receiver, no order information is added to the
   frames. The first/middle/last frame is marked in the CAN header to aid in reconstruction of the full
   datagram in the buffer.

   There's nothing in the Standard that says that CAN frames have to be maximal size.  A 9-byte datagram
   can be frames of 8 and 1, or 1 and 8.  This is helpful for handling, e.g., buffering and creation of
   dynamic content in the source node.

   The receiving node receives the frames into a buffer. The frames from more than one datagram may arrive
   in interleaved order, in which case the receiving node can tell them apart using their source NodeID
   alias and store them in separate buffers. (Any given source node can only send a single datagram at a
   time to a single destination node.) If sufficient buffers are not available, the receiving node rejects
   the second datagram with a “Resend OK”-flagged error code. The reject message can be sent early, so that
   buffer space to accumulate the datagram or even state bits to remember there is a data need not be
   allocated. Once the “datagram complete” indicator (i.e., an Only datagram or Last datagram message) is
   received for a datagram, the node replies to the original source node with a “Datagram Received OK” or
   “Datagram Rejected” message.

   The state machine for assembling datagram frames needs to know when, e.g., the lower levels reset, so
   that it knows to abandon a partially received datagram.  It can also recover upon seeing the next
   start/only frame.

   An interface or gateway onto a CAN link must do the datagram fragmentation and defragmentation locally.
   Buffer retries may be either done locally by the gateway, or by reflecting the response back to the
   original sender.

    2.7.3.2 Rejected Transmission

   There's no requirement for a specific response to out-of-spec transmissions. If a node receives
   out-of-spec datagram fragments, what it does is up to the receiving node. This is because it is neither
   necessary nor practical to specify a unique set of logic for dealing with the semi-infinite number of
   possible out-of-spec transmissions. Nodes can use the various error replies to indicate whatever they
   know, but they don't have to.

   For example, a node that receives a Middle datagram without a First datagram can react in various ways.
   It might send “Resend OK”, “Transport error”, both combined together, or simply ignore the message
   entirely.

   Notice, however, that receiving a second valid datagram sequence while receiving one (or more) that
   fills the local buffers is not an out-of-spec condition, and the protocol defines exactly how the node
   is to react. There's no flexibility in this case. The receiving node must send a Datagram Rejected
   message usually (but not necessarily) with the “Resend OK” error code.

                                           3 Background Information

3.1 Use Cases

   Here are some example application-level protocols that are or might be transported using datagrams.

   Memory configuration: Simple one-value reads and writes of configuration data are one-to-one operations
   that need to exchange 4-8-16-32 bytes of data.

   External-network control: If an OpenLCB segment is attached to single external networks, e.g. a DCC or
   LocoNet system, one-to-one transmission can be used to exchange native commands. E.g. “Send the
   following LocoNet message” may need to be up to 18 bytes long with current LocoNet definitions.
   Communication to LocoNet/DCC/etc. can be one-to-one to insure communications; return messages can be
   many one-to-one to listeners, but there's also a need for one-to-many or broadcast which is not
   addressed by the datagram transport.

   RFID tags carry 40 bits  of payload. Adding in some status and location information, reporting a RFID
   tag requires a 8-16 byte payload, and that's likely to grow in the future.

3.2 Discussion

   Datagrams are a one-to-one connection between nodes. They have a single source address and a single
   destination address, and only have to be delivered to that single destination. Delivery is guaranteed if
   the destination node is active, initialized and reachable, but it is not possible to guarantee in
   advance that a buffer is available in the destination to receive and assemble the datagram.

   At the high end, what's the maximum size for a datagram, beyond which it makes sense to move to a
   stream? The stream startup overhead is small, so that streams can be used for even small amounts of
   data. The maximum datagram size must be short enough that nodes can afford to have a fixed
   receive-and-process buffer for datagrams allocated, unlike streams that can be too large to buffer as a
   whole. As a balance between these, and to optimize certain layouts on CAN links, a size of 72 bytes has
   been selected. The OpenLCB protocols have been designed such that this can be extended to 128 bytes for
   specific application protocols if needed, while still maintaining backward compatibility with devices
   that only implement a 72-byte datagram size.

   At the low end, datagrams should go all the way down to zero bytes, because they are distinct from
   Events (which have a fixed 8-byte payload).

   The datagram protocol does not require error correction, because OpenLCB is based only on reliable links
   (that is, links that guarantee no content or order errors; but not necessarily a guarantee  that
   messages always end up effective at the remote destination). CAN, TCP/IP, etc., handle their own error
   correction. The datagram protocol needs flow control and synchronization, however, as a small node might
   not have resources to accumulate a large number of datagrams that are arriving in an interleaved order.
   The “Received OK” message is to inform small-capacity sending nodes that it can free its buffer holding
   the transmitted message.  

   On CAN links, the datagram protocol is constrained by the need the limited frame size. Datagrams must be
   broken into multiple frames for transfer. The protocol must allow for the possibility that datagrams to
   a particular node can be interleaved if several nodes are transmitting at the same time. Note that a
   node can control what it sends, so it is possible to ensure that only one datagram is being sent from a
   node at one time, just not that only one is being received.

   The datagram content formats rely on CAN not reordering frames, even in the presence of error recovery.
   That's needed in any case for streams, which are so large that complete internal buffering cannot be
   assumed.

3.3 Examples

  3.3.1 Normal CAN case

   Datagram First Frame →

   Datagram Middle Frame →

   Datagram Middle Frame →

   Datagram Last Frame →

   ← Datagram Received OK

  3.3.2 Short CAN datagram case

   Datagram Only Frame →

   ← Datagram Received OK

  3.3.3 Rejected short CAN datagram case

   Even a short datagram can be rejected with a “Resend OK” if there's, e.g. a shortage of buffers:

   Datagram Only Frame →

   ← Datagram Rejected, Resend OK

  3.3.4 Rejected interleaved CAN datagram case:

   Accidental interleave, at a node that can't handle that:

   Datagram First Frame from A →
   Datagram First Frame from B →
   ← Datagram Rejected, Resend OK to B
   Datagram Middle Frame from A →
   Datagram Last Frame from A →
   ← Datagram Received OK to A
   Datagram First Frame from B →
   Datagram Final Frame from B →
   ← Datagram Received OK to B

  3.3.5 Command/Reply Example

   Command Datagram →

   ← Datagram Received OK

   ← Reply Datagram

   Datagram Received OK →

  3.3.6 Back and Forth Datagram Protocol

   Small nodes may have only one datagram receive buffer and one datagram transmit buffer. In that case,
   sending multiple commands can result in poor performance if the replies go after the next request, e.g.:

   Command Datagram →

   ← Datagram Received OK

   ← Reply Datagram

   Command Datagram →

   Datagram Received OK →

   ← Datagram Received OK

   ← Reply Datagram

   Datagram Received OK →

   Note that the 2nd command was sent before the reply datagram was sent. This is valid, but nodes with
   only one buffer may not be able to handle that Read until the transmit buffer has been emptied by an
   acknowledgement. In that case, the sequence may become, e.g.:

   Command Datagram →

   ← Datagram Received OK

   ← Reply Datagram

   Command Datagram →

   ← Datagram Rejected, Resend OK

   Datagram Received OK →

   Command Datagram (retransmit) →

   ← Datagram Received OK

   ← Reply Datagram

   Datagram Received OK →

   which is significantly less efficient. Better to send the positive acknowledgement to the read reply
   datagram before sending the next read command.

3.4 Datagram Content

   There needs to be a method for identifying the content of a general datagram. OpenLCB is meant to be
   used with both very simple, low-end nodes, and high-end computers with multiple programs. In both those
   environments, it is inconvenient to have constraints like “the next datagram will carry…” because there
   might be more than one thing going on, and it is hard to write code that knows about lots of global
   state information. It must be possible to interleave, e.g., configuration datagrams (messages) with
   datagrams that are displaying messages. Therefore, most datagrams will carry information about which
   conversation they are part of. We call that information “datagram content identification”.

   We also want  “datagram content IDs” to be small, unique, unambiguous, easily assigned, etc. To do that,
   there are two basic approaches:

     * A one-byte ID field with a central sequential method of assignment. It is called the “Datagram
       Protocol ID”. This is small, so doesn't use much space on CAN, but requires central recording of
       IDs.

     * A 6-byte field assigned the same way that node unique identifiers are. The protocol designer(s) uses
       a unique ID they control to identify the new protocol they are defining. This takes significantly
       more space, particularly on CAN, but is simple to maintain and requires no central registration.

   The plan is to use both. There will be a one-byte field, with certain values to escape to a two-byte
   field (reserved for future use), and to a six-byte fully-unique field. A separate spreadsheet is
   accumulating values.

3.5 Numerology

   This section discusses how big the maximum datagram payload can be. This is a decision that must balance
   buffer size versus utility of the protocol. Memory is scarce in a small node. Although it is possible to
   incrementally process parts of a datagram as they arrive, in general it will be necessary to have a
   buffer of the maximum possible size available when a datagram is arriving. (That same buffer can be used
   to send datagrams, if needed) At the same time, datagrams that are too small to contain a useful atomic
   message, requiring  extra coding work.

   If one byte is used for the datagram content ID field (see §3.4), the first CAN-link datagram contains 7
   payload bytes (the following datagrams can contain 8). The datagram format field counts as part of the
   information that the datagram is transporting, though. We could make the maximum datagram size nine
   segments, (9*8) = 72-1 data bytes, to ensure that even with a little bit of additional overhead from an
   application-layer protocol, say up to 6 bytes, 64 bytes of actual data can be delivered at a shot.

   Alternately, because of the binary nature of addressing, a 64-byte buffer size might be more convenient
   that a 72-byte one, even at the cost of some lost possible capacity in the last frame.

   For external protocols, e.g. support for LocoNet, XpressNet, DCC, etc., it is a great simplification if
   the datagrams can carry any basic message of the external protocol in a single datagram. Is 64 data
   bytes then enough? The evidence at hand suggests that 64 data bytes is more than sufficient.

   Thus the decision for nine segments, 72 bytes, and developers should code this as a constant to the
   extent possible.

3.6 Future Extensions

   In this version of the datagram protocol, there is no provision for multiple recipients of a single
   message. Transmission is strictly one-to-one. This constraint is not because of addressed nature of
   datagrams (making the messages globally visible is not hard), but rather the need for guaranteed
   buffering at the receiving node. In the future, we may want to provide one-to-many datagrams.

   For this to work, the recipient will need to have a buffer into which any datagram in flight can be
   received. On a tiny node, those might be a scarce resource. But, without any protocol support, e.g. if
   datagrams were “fire and forget” like event notifications, you might need to have a very large number of
   those buffers. There's nothing in the protocol that prevents nodes A, B, C and D from firing off a
   datagram at node X at the same time, and having their CAN frames be interleaved when they arrive at
   X.(The stream protocol negotiates this in advance, but that requires time and resources only appropriate
   to large transfers) To properly receive them, X needs N=4 buffers to reassemble them in this case. But
   how big an N is really required? The recipient cannot  know, so instead we add protocol support: X can
   tell nodes sending it datagrams to repeat them. That way X can accept as many datagrams as it has
   buffers (at least one), while telling the others to “say that again, please, I wasn't paying attention
   the first time”.

   A sending node knows that it has to hang onto the datagram until it receives a “Received OK” message,
   because if the sender receives a “Rejected, Resend OK” it needs to still have the content to resend it.
   The “Received OK” and “Rejected, Resend OK” are not about data loss on a link, but about buffer
   management in tiny nodes. A one-to-many protocol could also do something like that, because the
   transmitter still knows how many “many” is. Global broadcast, like events, is hard because the
   transmitter's buffer management gets complicated unless it knows how many nodes are listening for its
   reply.

   Although Bosch has proposed a new standard called CAN-FD1, which permits frames as large as 64 bytes, we
   have decided not to reduce maximum size of a datagram to fit easily within this frame size in order to
   ease migration in the long-term. There are good reasons to retain the possibility of larger-than-64-byte
   datagrams, e.g. so you can have a header of N bytes on the front of 64 data bytes. All that is needed is
   to ensure the datagram spec can work with larger frames of any length.

3.7 Implementation Notes

   A resource-constrained node can get along with a single datagram buffer for both sending and receiving,
   but this may require that the node be able to abandon and recreate a datagram that it is trying to
   transmit. This can happen when, e.g.:

     * Node A creates a datagram for node B in its buffer and starts to send it.

     * Before starting to receive the datagram from A, node B creates a datagram for Node A in its buffer
       and starts to send it.

   Both datagrams now need a place to put the incoming datagram, but only have one buffer in this example.
   They can both send “Rejected, Resend OK”, but then their peer will just repeat the attempt to send. At
   least one has to drop the content from its datagram buffer and receive the datagram to avoid deadly
   embrace. This can also happen in other contexts too, but only when sharing a buffer between transmit and
   reception. It is therefore easiest for an implementation to provide for two buffers if it is likely to
   send and receive datagrams asynchronously.

   The datagram protocol allows all nodes to reject a datagram when it has been totally received. CAN and
   other wire protocols, because they require fragmentation of the datagram into smaller segments,
   therefore also allow an early rejection of a datagram. This mechanism can help keep buffers clear, but
   it is not required that CAN implementations use this mechanism..
