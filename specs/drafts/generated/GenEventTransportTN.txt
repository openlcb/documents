                                                1 Introduction

   This Technical Note contains informative discussion and background for the corresponding “OpenLCB CAN
   Event Transport Standard”. This explanation is not normative in any way.

   OpenLCB nodes respond to local inputs and state changes by emitting Producer/Consumer Event Report
   (PCER) messages. When they do this, they are acting as “Producers”. OpenLCB nodes receive these
   messages, and can act on them locally if desired. If they do so, they are acting as “Consumers”.
   Together, this is called the Producer-Consumer Model of system control.  In this model a particular
   concept, or event, is the sum of the inputs that trigger the production of the PCER by the producer(s)
   and the action(s) taken by the consumer(s).  Its main advantage is the knowledge independence it imparts
   between all of the nodes involved in an event.  Expressed in more anthropomorphic terms, neither the
   producers nor consumers or a PCER are aware of each other.  This adds flexibility to the system, since
   more producers or consumers of the PCER can be added to implement the associated event, without concern
   of side effects to the the other nodes involved in the event.i12

   The P/C Event ID included in a PCER message is a 8-byte unique identifier. The method for assigning
   these and ensuring their uniqueness is in the Event ID Standard and Technical Note.

   There are many possible ways to use these 64 bits, some of which are discussed as examples below. In
   particular, OpenLCB does not require or enforce any particular partitioning of the eight bytes. More
   than one node may emit the same P/C Event ID (note that the Node ID of the emitting node is available
   separately in the message). More than one node may receive and act on a PCER message with a specific P/C
   Event ID. The only requirement is that the 8-byte quantity be unique to the event.

                                        2 Annotations to the Standard

   This section provides background information on corresponding sections of the Specification document.
   It's expected that two documents will be read together.

2.1 Introduction

    

2.2 Intended Use

    

   A particular PCER may be produced in response to physical input or state change on a layout, for example
   a contact closure or the activation of a block occupancy detector, or it can be in response to a
   non-physical change such as the arrival of a certain time.  The same PCER can be produced by several
   different state changes.  That PCER may result in some action at consumers.   The term 'event' includes
   the state changes, the PCER message, and the resulting actions, and represent a specific idea or
   concept, such as “Night has fallen”.  

   For example, the concept of  an “Emergency stop” event might include the actions of turning off track
   power, turning on a fault-indicator, and sounding a buzzer.  The PCER may be produced by any of: a panic
   button, a throttle button, an over-current detector, or an anti-collision system.  

   The aforementioned “Night has fallen” event might be triggered by a fast-clock time, a toggle switch, or
   a control program, and its actions might include illuminating street lights, house lights, and the
   dimming of overhead lighting.  

   In addition, ranges of PCERs can be used for specific purposes.  For example, a fast clock's messages
   can be implemented as a range of PCERs, where the low order bytes are the time.

2.4 Message Formats

   The range mask is implemented as a combined base value and mask, where the mask bits are the lowest n
   bits of the same value as the lowest bit.  For example, the event-mask 0xABCD0000 would form the range
   0xABCD0000-ABCDFFFF, since the lowest bit is a “0”and the mask bits extends to the first “1” bit, in
   this case the the  low bit of the 'D' hex-digit.  Similarly, the event-mask 0xFEDCBFFF would form the
   range 0xFEDC8000-FEDCBFFF, since the low-bit is a “1”, and lowest “0” bit is in the 0xB = 0b1011, and at
   the third bit position.      The smallest ranges are specified by 0xyyyyyyyE, which specifies a range of
   0xyyyyyyyE-0xyyyyyyyF, and 0xyyyyyyyD which specifies 0xyyyyyyyC-0xyyyyyyyF.   0X00000001 gives
   0x00000000-0x00000001, and 0x00000002 gives 0x00000000-0x00000002, 0x00000003 gives
   0x00000000-0x00000003

  2.4.1 Producer/Consumer Event Report (PCER)

   This message transports an Event-number from a producer node(s) to zero or more unspecified consumer
   nodes.  It's the backbone of the protocol, and forms most of the expected traffic.

   The source node ID allows identification of which node sent the event. This can be used for diagnostic
   and status purposes, but nodes must act on the event without regard to where it came from.

  2.4.2 Identify Consumer

   This message is broadcast and requests every node to report if they consume this Event ID.  

  2.4.3 Consumer Identified

   This message is broadcast, in response to a received Identify Consumer message, from each node that
   consumes the included Event ID.  Nodes also send this as part of their startup so that other nodes know
   they want to consume particular events.

   This is one of the messages that allows bridges to do automatic routing of event messages.

   The “valid”, “invalid”, “unknown” subforms are used to attempt to recover the state of the overall
   system.  In general, event transmission via PCER messages conveys state changes. If a node comes in
   during operation, it might want to determine the correct value of the distributed state. Producers can,
   but don't always, know that state.  For example, consider “On” and “Off” events for a light.  There
   might be two producers attached to toggle switch. In that case, one of them will still see their state
   as current, and will reply with valid. Alternately, the two producers might be set to produce when two
   separate pushbuttons are pressed.  In that case, at some later time neither producer knows whether the
   distributed state corresponds to its event. They both have to report as unknown. Consumers can also know
   the state.  The lamp controller that consumes the “On” and “Off” probably knows whether it's currently
   providing power to the lamp, and so can reply with valid for one event and invalid for the other.

  2.4.4 Consumer Range Identified

   This message broadcasts, in response to a received Identify Consumer message, from each node that
   consumes event is in the range specified by the included event-ID-with-mask.  This is one of the
   messages that allows bridges to do automatic routing of event messages.     

   The 50% is to allow rounding up to the enclosing bit, but no further.  

  2.4.5 Identify Producer

   This message is broadcast and requests every node to report whether they produce this Event ID.  

  2.4.6 Producer Identified

   This message is broadcast, in response to a received Identify Producer message, from each node that
   produces the included Event ID.  This is one of the messages that allows bridges to do automatic routing
   of event messages.  

  2.4.7 Producer Range Identified

   The 50% is to allow rounding up to the enclosing bit, but no further.

   An example of a producer range would be a fast clock node that sends a range of events to indicate the
   time. Since there are 24*60*60 = 86,400 seconds in a day, it needs a range containing 86,400 events.
    That could be expressed in 17 bits, so if the range was to start with an Event ID of
   0x12.34.56.78.00.00.00.00, the range could be expressed as  0x12.34.56.78.00.01.FF.FF  using 1 bits to
   represent the mask.  If the range had to start at  0x12.34.56.78.FF.FE.00.00 for some reason, 1 bits
   would not properly represent the mask because  0x12.34.56.78.FF.FF.FF.FF is actually a different range.
   Using a 0 bit for the mask would work, giving  0x12.34.56.78.FF.FE.00.00 as the representation.

   This message is broadcast, in response to a received Identify Producer message, from each node that
   produces events in the range specified by the included event-ID-with-mask.  This is one of the messages
   that allows bridges to do automatic routing of event messages.

  2.4.8 Identify Events

   Two forms of identify events; recommendation on uses for global form

   In some cases, the node may want to query a specific node as to whether id produces that event, in these
   case the directed form is appropriate.  In other cases, the node producing the Identify Event will not
   know if any node uses that event, and therefore the global form is the more appropriate choice.  Be
   aware that since this latter form is transmitted throughout the network, it can be relatively expensive
   in terms of bandwidth.  

2.5 States

   After the IC message is sent, but before any  Producer/Consumer Event Report messages are sent, each
   node must identify all events produced or consumed  via zero or more Identify Consumers, Identify
   Consumed Range, Identify Producers and Identify Consumed Range messages. These are not required to be in
   any particular order.

2.6 Interactions

   Nothing prevents extra Producer/Consumer Identified messages. Nothing prevents combining replies to
   multiple requests.  This allows simplified implementations, for example setting a bit to indicate that a
   reply can be sent when time/priority is available.

   You can send identify/identified messages for automatically-routed Event IDs.  Identify
   Producer/Consumer for well-known Event IDs require response; there's no exemption for those.

   The state of the system can sometimes  be constructed from the received Producer/Consumer Identified
   messages and their “valid”, “invalid”, “unknown” subforms.  It is possible that these will result in
   conflicting and/or ambiguous state.

   Note that the Advertised/Not-Advertised state machine  is reset by  the Initialization Complete message,
   and not by any  lower level link (CAN or other) state machine.

   Delay in sending the PI/PRI or CI/CRI messages after IC is OK, but there's no delivery guarantee for
   this node's events until those have been sent.  

   When a node changes the events it manages, it still needs to emit the PI/PRI and/or CI/CRI messages.
    For example, reconfiguration could cause this.  It can be handled by sending individual messages, or by
   resetting and sending them all as part of that process.

   There is no way to indicate that a node is no longer interested in a particular Event ID.  (Sending IC
   again says that all events are not interesting, though).  This could be added, but it's much harder for
   gateways to decide that an Event ID is not interesting than that it is interesting, because they have to
   keep a list of all the node IDs that are interested,and back that off.  Better to just let  the set of
   interesting Event IDs grow until the layout or gateway is reset.

   To ensure that event messages are properly routed, nodes must announce when they start to produce or
   consume messages. Specifically, they must do this at two times:

     * When the node is first initialized, after  the “Initialization Complete” message has been sent.

     * When a configuration change has added another Event ID that can be produced or consumed.

   To announce new Event IDs, the node must transmit a Producer Identified message for each P/C Event ID it
   can newly produce, and a Consumer Identified message for each P/C Event ID that it can newly consume.  

  2.6.1 Event Transfer

   The last sentence is the key to gateway traffic reduction. See below.

  2.6.2 Event Enquiry

   Two forms of identify events; recommendation on uses for global form. This can be a huge load, and
   should only be used when needed.  

   The two forms of this message are sent to request that the specified nodes report all the events they
   produce or consume.  These reports can be ether Identified messages specifying individual Event IDs or
   ranges of events.  One form is an unaddressed message sent globally to all nodes, and the other is an
   addressed message to a specific node.

   It is useful to be able to rapidly determine which, if any, P/C Event IDs that a particular node is
   listening for and that it can emit.

   This can be used as a configuration diagnostic.

   To determine which P/C Event IDs can be send by a particular node, the inquiring node sends an Identify
   Events message addressed to the target node.

   The node must reply with a Producer Identified message for each P/C Event ID it can produce, and a
   Consumer Identified message for each P/C Event ID for which it is listening.

  2.6.3 Producer Enquiry

   It is useful to be able to determine which, if any, nodes are configured to possibly emit a specific P/C
   Event ID message and their current state.

   This can be used as a configuration diagnostic, and as a way of building filtering and routing tables.

   To determine which nodes can send a particular P/C Event ID, a node sends an Identify Producers message
   carrying the desired P/C Event ID. This is an unaddressed message addressed to all nodes.

   All nodes that are listening for that P/C Event ID reply with a Producer Identified broadcast message.

   The “valid” bit indicates that the node's internal condition is consistent with sending this P/C Event
   ID. For example, assume a node sends P/C Event ID 2 when the input goes active and P/C Event ID 4 when
   the input goes inactive. Then if the input was active and the node was asked about P/C Event ID 2, it
   would reply “valid”; if asked about P/C Event ID 4, it would reply “not valid”. Depending on the node's
   structure, it might not always be possible to set the “valid” bit with certainty, in which case the
   “unknown” bit must be set.

   You can query a state when you come up with the request-id message. Conflicting states can happen, and
   have to be addressed. You might also want to enquire of the consumers if you don't get a definitive
   answer from the producers.

   In regard to valid/invalid/unknown, it is  always possible to send only unknown, or to ignore the three
   sub-forms, but a lot of capability is then lost.  

  2.6.4 Consumer Enquiry

   It is useful to be able to determine which, if any, nodes are listening for a specific P/C Event ID
   message.

   This can be used as a configuration diagnostic, and as a way of building routing tables.

   To determine which nodes are listening for a particular P/C Event ID, a node sends an Identify Consumers
   message carrying the desired P/C Event ID. This is an unaddressed message processed by all nodes.

   All nodes that are listening for that P/C Event ID reply with a Consumer Identified broadcast message.

   The “valid” bit indicates that the node is currently in the state it would be if this message had been
   received last. For example, assume a node sets its output active for P/C Event ID 2, and inactive for a
   P/C Event ID 4. Then if the output was active and the node was asked about P/C Event ID 2, it would
   reply "valid"; if asked about P/C Event ID 4, it would reply "not valid". Depending on the node's
   structure, it might not always be possible to set the “valid” bit with certainty, in which case the
   “unknown” bit must be set.

                                          3 Background information 

   This section is general information of interest to the reader, implementers, etc.

   Performance & loading at node startup, layout startup particularly on CAN. Numbers and simulations.

   The distributed-state model of a layout.  “Events” broadcast state transitions, which individual
   producers and consumers use to change their knowledge of the distributed state.  

   Include some examples and figures from
   http://openlcb.org/trunk/documents/notes/ProducerConsumerModel.html ?

3.1 Gateways

   Gateways can route PCERs only to segments with nodes expressing interest by processing the other event
   messages.

   The automatically-routed event range has to be routed. This can be done by making a permanent entry in
   routing tables, or any other implementation method.

   Merge the example in http://openlcb.org/trunk/documents/examples/CAN-TCP-CAN-TCP-example.html

3.2 Implementation hints

   Buffering issues, particularly on CAN: a node has to be able to keep up with PCER messages that can
   arrive about every millisecond (125000 bps / 120 bits per message)

     * Don't  do long linear searches to match an incoming Event ID to internal structures.

     * Instead, consider just decoding the Event ID and setting a “process as available” bit, and then
       doing further work outside the CAN receive loop.

   There is no requirement that events be processed in any particular order. Multiple PCER messages with
   the same Event ID may result in multiple actions inside a consumer, or may not, depending on the details
   of the consumer.   

3.3 Well known events

   There are a small number of cases where a globally-allocated and reserved Event ID will simplify
   operation. These “well-known Event ID numbers” can be used to e.g. advertise that a node can provide a
   specific capability, or to tell locomotive control hardware to stop all trains instantly, etc.

   For these to be useful, they not only have to be unique (so there are no collisions that accidentally
   trigger reactions to them), but they must also be well-known. So we have created a central spreadsheet
   on which uses can be recorded. This will eventually provide a machine-accessible record.

   All of these are assigned with a reserved ID in their upper six bytes to ensure uniqueness and simplify
   recognition.

   Nodes using these must mention them when listing the event IDs they produce and consume. Gateways may
   filter on these, but are not required to. (For ease of implementation, a gateway may just pass all
   events with the common top 6 bytes).

3.4 History section

   For monitoring purposes, it was proposed that a PCER message carry a sequence number which increments
   each time the associated P/C Event ID is sent. It is not at all clear how to do this across nodes, or
   even across Producers within a single node, as there may be more than one thing that can cause the same
   P/C Event ID to be sent by a single board;. We decided this would cause more problems than it solved,
   and omitted it.

   There's not room in a CAN frame for both a destination NID and a EID. The protocol has therefore been
   constructed so that any message carrying an EID (and that isn't a datagram) is globally addressed.
