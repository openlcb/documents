                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   The OpenLCB suite of protocols can be used on multiple physical transports; this document describes the
   specifics that relate to using a TCP/IP link as a link layer. This specification defines unique headers
   to provide message traceability, node addressing and priority management.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   This Standard is intended for use whenever OpenLCB nodes are communicating over a reliable byte-stream
   link, e.g. a TCP/IP connection. It is not intended to cover OpenLCB communications over other types of
   communications links.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   In this document, the term "OpenLCB-TCP" refers to details of OpenLCB nodes that are specific to using a
   TCP transport, as opposed to generic OpenLCB protocol or OpenLCB using other transports.

   This specification should be interpreted in the the context of the following OpenLCB Standards:

     * The OpenLCB Unique Identifiers Standard, which specifies the mechanism(s) for providing a unique
       identifier for each node

   Each OpenLCB node (independent of transport layer in use) shall have a unique identifier.  When using a
   CAN bus transport, that identifier shall be used as its node identifier (NodeID).

   For more information on format and presentation, see:

     * OpenLCB Common Information Technical Note

                                         4 Message Format (Normative)

   Individual messages are preceded by a preamble that contains:

     * Flags - 16 bit quantity.

          * The most significant bit indicates whether the remaining message is a common OpenLCB message
            (1) or a link control message (0).

               * The 2nd most significant bit is a chaining bit, indicating that another header is
                 contained within this one.

               * The next 2 bits, the rest of the upper nibble of the flags, are reserved. They should be
                 sent as zero and checked as zero on receipt.

               * The 0x0030 bits are used to indicate multiple-part messages

                    * 0b00 indicates a single-part message.

                    * 0b01 indicates the first part of a multiple-part message

                    * 0b11 indicates the center part of a multiple part message

                    * 0b10 indicates the last part of a multiple-part message

               * The lower 10 bits are reserved.  They are to be sent as zero on and ignored upon receipt.

     * Number of bytes in rest of message, a 24-bit quantity. This includes both the rest of the prefix and
       the actual message content.

     * Originating node/gateway Node ID – the Node ID of the node or gateway that sent/forwarded this
       message onto the link. May or may not be the original source of the message.

     * Message capture time at originating gateway - a 48-bit number of monotonic milliseconds since the
       connection was created or some arbitrary time before; no time synchronization with other nodes
       implied; no precision required, only monotonicity; could have been a sequence number

   The message itself is sent in the order:

     * MTI – 16 bits total.

     * Source Node ID – the full node ID of the node originating the message

     * Destination Node ID (if indicated by the MTI) – the full node ID of the destination node

     * Event ID (if indicated by the MTI) – an Event ID

     * Other content – in byte order

5.1 Multiple-part Messages

   Multiple messages with a non-zero value of the multipart-message field in the prefix may, but need not
   be, combined into a single message. This process shall:

     * Preserve the order of the message contents

     * Only combine message parts with equal values of MTI, source node ID and (if the presence of one is
       indicated by the MTI) destination node ID.

     * Only combine message parts when all contained prefix(es) contain the same value(s) in the matching
       originating node/gateway Node ID field.

     * Only combine parts if the first part combined has a 1 in the 0x0010 bit, the last part combined has
       a 1 in the 0x0020 bit, and parts that are neither first nor last have a 0x11 in the 0x0030 field of
       the prefix.

   The value of the 0x0020 bit in the resulting prefix shall come from the 1st part combined. The value of
   the 0x0010 bit in the resulting prefix shall come from the last part combined.The contained prefixes
   shall be updated to include the full data count, and the lowest seen value of the message capture time
   at the originating gateway.

                                                6 Interactions

   A node transmits a message to another node across a TCP link by first sending a prefix, then the
   message.

   If the node is forwarding a message that was received across another TCP link, it includes all prefixes
   received with the message and sets the chaining bit.  The transmission is then the newest prefix, all
   prefix prefixes in reverse time order, and then the OpenLCB message.
