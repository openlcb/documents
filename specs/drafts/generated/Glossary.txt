                                                1 Introduction

   This glossary provides working definitions and commentary on definitions for OpenLCB. It is not
   normative in any way.

   We provide a separate section of “Key Terms” for initial reading.

                                                 2 Key Terms

   Event

   OpenLCB allows nodes to notify each other when specific "events" occur on the layout. These in turn can
   cause nodes to take particular actions. Events are not necessarily attached to a producer ('Button 2
   pressed') or attached to a consumer ('Turn off light 4'), but rather to an overall state change ('Set
   for nighttime operation'). This is called a "Producer/Consumer model".

   Node

   A “node” is the basic unit of addressability in OpenLCB.  It can be a single board, or a process in a
   larger computer, or any other independent actor on the OpenLCB network.

   Every OpenLCB interaction originates in a node. Every board that connects to OpenLCB is at least one
   node. For example, a simple turnout controller board is one node, while a PC with multiple programs
   running may contain several nodes.

   Message

   The basic unit of OpenLCB communication. OpenLCB nodes exchange messages to control communications and
   to move information.  It may take several messages to move a single datagram, or to start a stream, for
   example.

   Protocol

   An OpenLCB protocol defines how messages are exchanged to do some particular thing.  OpenLCB protocols
   are layered, with higher-level protocols being implemented with lower-level protocols.  Low level
   protocols are used for things like sending datagrams, exchanging events, and doing link start-up.
    Higher-level protocols then define how configuration information is exchanged, or a nodes memory can be
   read, or a message can be put on a display.

                                              3 General Glossary

    

   Addressed

   An “addressed” message is meant for only a single node. Contrast “global”.

   Alias

   Short form of a Node ID (NID) number which can be mapped back and forth to the full number. Often used
   with a modifier, as "NID Alias", "DID Alias" or "SID Alias"", where DID and SID are specific types of
   Node ID (see below), and which are then written NIDa, DIDa and SIDa. Only used in certain forms of the
   OpenLCB protocols, e.g. on CAN links.

   Automatically Routed Event

   The Event transfer protocol defines a series of messages that determine where Event messages must be
   routed. Automatically Routed Events are events within a particular part of the EventID space that are
   routed to all nodes, without using those messages.  See the Event transfer protocol documentation for
   more information.

   Board

   “Board” has no precise meaning in OpenLCB.  It generally refers to a single piece of electronics.
   Sometimes used to refer to “the piece of electronics that implements a Node”.  Note that a Board may may
   contain one or more Nodes.  

   Bridge

   Usually a bridge works on the data link layer of the OSI model, and therefore has knowledge only about
   those messages transferred, but not about the meaning of the messages as they are defined in a higher
   layer of the OSI model, such as at the transport layer. Similarly to a repeater, a bridge may be used to
   allow the connection of more nodes than is possible on one segment due to physical limitations, but this
   is not its main purpose.  Usually a bridge does not translate between different wire protocols, and for
   that a gateway is used.  A bridge differs from a repeater in that a bridge can forward messages to
   different segments based on Node ID.  To do this, the bridge listens to and interprets the messages
   transferred in order to learn which nodes are connected to which segment. For OpenLCB the bridge may
   also support different node aliases on the different segments to which it is connected. It this case, it
   would translate the node alias before forwarding that frame to another segment.

   CDI

   “Configuration Definition Information”, the information provided by a node so that other nodes can
   understand what the configuration information in the first node includes, and how it's organized.  

   Datagram

   The actual data content transported by the Datagram Protocol.  This can be up to 72 bytes.

   Datagram Protocol

   The datagram protocol is a way for a OpenLCB node to efficiently send a short, definite-length message
   to another specific node.  In that, it lies in between the event exchange protocol, which efficiently
   sends very short event IDs to all interested nodes, and the streaming protocol, which sends long
   messages between specific nodes, at some cost in efficiency. Sending a datagram can take multiple
   messages on limited transports, such as CAN.

   Datagram Protocol ID (DPID or DPI)

   The first byte of data transferred by a datagram is used to indicate the protocol being transported.

   Device

   "Device" has no precise meaning in OpenLCB. It generally refers to a single piece of equipment on a
   layout connected to a Node.

   Destination Node ID (DID)

    The Node ID of the node to which a specific message is addressed.

   Event Exchange Protocol

   This protocol uses PCER (Producer-Consumer Event Report) messages to propagate Event IDs from source
   nodes to multiple destination nodes. These messages are typically used to announce that something of
   interest has happened on the layouts, and consequencely a change in the layout's state, so that
   controlled devices can respond. The protocol also includes inquiry and response messages for examining
   configuration and status.  

   Event ID (EID)

   The number that identifies a specific event. OpenLCB event IDs must be globally unique.

   NB: Events are not associated with any particular node.  It may be convenient to use, for example,  Node
   ID as a way of numbering them uniquely, but Node IDs and Event IDs are directly not related.

   Gateway

   A Gateway translates between different wire protocols (e.g. CAN and ethernet), or even different network
   architectures (e.g. OpenLCB and Loconet).  They repackage and convert data going from one environment to
   another so that each environment can understand the other's data.  Since OpenLCB uses unique
   identifiers, and these are meant to be used unchanged on most wire protocols, this should reduce the
   necessity of Gateways.  

   Global

   A “global” message is meant for all OpenLCB nodes that are interested in it.  Contrast “Addressed”.

   Installation

   An OpenLCB installation is the complete set of OpenLCB hardware, nodes, etc, that can be reached from
   any one of them.

   Message Type Indicator (MTI)

   Every OpenLCB message contains a Message Type Indicator field that identifies the type of that
   particular message.  Also used to refer to a particular value for that field.

   Node ID (NID)

   Number identifying a specific node. OpenLCB node IDs must be globally unique, so they form a one-to-one
   mapping to the nodes themselves.

   Producer/Consumer Model

   A way of thinking about communications on a layout network. Events (unique messages on the layout
   network) are “produced” by some node(s), and “consumed” by other node(s). An event indicates something
   happened, but the corresponding message isn't necessarily a status report or a command for something to
   change; it's just an announcement of the event. That event can be produced by many different sources
   (e.g. the “use passing siding” event could be produced by a push button at either end of the siding, or
   on a dispatcher panel), and can be consumed by several sources (it can turn on lamps on a panel, set
   turnouts in multiple places, set an internal software flag, etc).

   Producer-Consumer Event Report (PCER)

   OpenLCB message type sent globally by producers of a particular Event to indicate that it has occurred,
   so that the corresponding consumers of that Event are notified.

   Repeater

   Connects two segments of the same type at the physical layer of the OSI model. It regenerates the
   received signals and then retransmits the regenerated (or conditioned) signals on the other segment. It
   has no knowledge of the information transferred. It is usually used to connect two like segments, e.g.
   two CAN segments, to allow more nodes to be attach to the combined segments as if they were one.  They
   can be used to overcome physical limitations of a segment, such as maximum number of nodes, or segment
   length.  

   Router

   Routers work at the Network layer of the OSI model, meaning that they can route frames across multiple
   segments based  on only the information contained in messages. They do not have knowledge about
   protocols of (higher) transport layers. Routers are usually used in complex network situations because
   they provide better traffic management than bridges, such as traffic filtering, and do not pass
   broadcast traffic. Routers can share status and routing information with one another, and can use this
   information to bypass slow or malfunctioning segments.  

   Source Node ID (SID)

   The Node ID of the node which originated a specific message.

   Segment

   Subset of an overall OpenLCB installation which uses a specific wire protocol.   A segment never spans
   over Bridges, Gateways, Repeaters or Routers.

   Simple Node

   A “simple node” is typically an individual board with a small processor on it which is acting a as leaf
   node in an OpenLCB network. A simple node doesn't initiate complex communications with other nodes, but
   may be the target of  configuration operations, for example.

   Stream

   Streams are a method of moving a large number of bytes between two nodes. The streaming protocol defines
   a way to do this in OpenLCB.  

   Streaming Protocol

   Protocol that defines the messages and interactions to setup a stream transfer, move the data along with
   the necessary buffer management, and then take down the transfer at the end.  Streams are efficient ways
   to move large amounts of data when the setup and take-down process can be considered a negligible part
   of the total transfer.

   Virtual Node

   One of one or more nodes co-resident within a single board or computer. Often a board is a single node,
   but it's possible for a board or computer to behave on the OpenLCB as if it contained multiple nodes.
   Those are then referred to as virtual nodes.

   Well Known Events

   Certain Events are globally defined to have specific meanings. Their Event IDs are documented as part of
   the event protocol.

   Wire protocol

   The version of the OpenLCB common messages, interactions, etc. adapted to a particular transport
   mechanism. Examples are the wire protocols for CAN bus segments and TCP/IP links.

                                                4 CAN Glossary

   Alias

   See the general definition.  On CAN an Alias is a 12-bit mapping of the Node ID.

   CAN

   Controller Area Network, an ISO-standardized communication network type. The CAN specification includes
   aspects of the physical- and link-layer definitions for OpenLCB.

   Frame

   A Frame is packet as it is defined on the CAN bus. It consists of a 11 or 29 bit CAN header,  zero
   through 8 bytes of data, and some additional bits and fields. An OpenLCB message may become one or more
   frames when transmitted over CAN. Some frames, called Control Frames, are used for link-layer control
   and do not correspond to any particular OpenLCB message, and are used in the management of Node ID
   Aliases

   OpenLCB-CAN

   Short form for “OpenLCB as implemented on a CAN link”. For example, “OpenLCB-CAN message” refers to an
   OpenLCB message formatted for transmission over a CAN link.

   Segment

   See general definition.  Note that nodes on a single CAN segment share CAN arbitration and a set of
   aliases.
