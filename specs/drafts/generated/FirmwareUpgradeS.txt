                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This Standard defines a method for using OpenLCB protocols for upgrading the firmware of an OpenLCB
   node. This Standard is agnostic to the physical layer.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   This method is expected to be implemented in common Configuration Tool (CT) software packages. Any
   hardware device that is able to follow the interactions defined here and thereby receive a firmware
   upgrade through this method will be able to be updated using commonly available CT software. This
   reduces the burden of the manufacturers in that they don't need to develop and provide tools and user
   interface for firmware upgrade capability, as well as increases user satisfaction, because the user does
   not have to acquire and learn to use a new tool for each hardware manufacturer, but can use a tool she
   is already familiar with to update all conforming hardware nodes.

   This Standard does not define new protocols, but identifies a specific subset of the OpenLCB protocol
   stack that is necessary for the firmware upgrade to function, and defines the exact sequence of
   operations that are expected to happen during a firmware upgrade.

   The intended use of this subset is to allow manufacturers to supply their hardware with dual firmware,
   consisting of a “firmware upgrade” component with the minimum required support for firmware update, as
   well as a replaceable “production” firmware for full node operation.

     * OpenLCB Common Information Technical Note

   For information on OpenLCB message transport and OpenLCB communications, see:

     * OpenLCB Message Network Standard. That Standard also defines the Uninitialized state and the Node
       Initialization Complete message, as well as the Protocol Support protocol messages.

   The defined method relies on commands and messages defined in the following standards:

     * OpenLCB Memory Configuration Standard, which defines, among others, the commands  “Freeze”,
       “Unfreeze”, “Write” and “Stream Write”.

     * OpenLCB Stream Transport Draft Standard, which defined how streams are opened, data transferred,
       aborted with error and completed.

                                        4 Message Formats (Normative)

   This Standard does not define any messages.

                                             5 States (Normative)

   A powered-on hardware node may be in one of the following two states:

     * Firmware Upgrade state. In this state the node supports a writable Memory Space under the number of
       the Firmware Space to receive the firmware upgrade data, as defined in the firmware upgrade
       interaction. The hardware is not expected to perform any of its regular operations. The OpenLCB node
       shall still be standards compliant.

     * Operating state. In this state the node performs its desired function. The node in Operating state
       must not export a writable Memory Space under the number of the Firmware Space.

                                          6 Interactions (Normative)

6.1 Definitions

   There are two nodes involved in the firmware upgrade process:

   The Configuration Tool (CT) is the node with a user interface that is in possession of the new
   manufacturer-supplied firmware data file.

   The Target Node is the node whose firmware is being updated.

6.2 State transitions

   A node may not transition between Firmware Upgrade state and Operating state without returning to
   Uninitialized state, as defined by the OpenLCB Message Network standard.

   At power-up a hardware node shall start up in Operating state by default, unless one of the following
   conditions hold:

     * Regular operation is impossible due to the lack of a working firmware. In this case the Target Node
       may, but is not required to, emit a Producer-Consumer Event Report (PCER) message with the
       Well-Known Event ID “Firmware Corrupted” after reaching Initialized state.

     * The user has requested firmware upgrade mode using a hardware switch, if one is available. In this
       case, the Target Node may, but is not required to, emit a PCER message with the Well-Known Event ID
       “Firmware Upgrade Requested by Hardware Switch” after reaching Initialized state.

   To request a Target Node to transition from Firmware Upgrade state to Operating state, the Configuration
   Tool shall send a Memory Configuration protocol “Unfreeze” command for the memory space designated as
   Firmware Space. The Target Node shall acknowledge the completion of the state transition by sending a
   Node Initialization Complete message.

   To request a Target Node to transition to Firmware Upgrade state (from either Firmware Upgrade or
   Operating state), a Configuration Tool shall send a Memory Configuration protocol “Freeze” command for
   the memory space designated as Firmware space. The node shall acknowledge the completion of the state
   transition by sending a Node Initialization Complete message.

6.3 State identification

   A Target Node that supports the Firmware Upgrade Standard shall set the following bit(s) in the Protocol
   Support Reply message depending on its state:

   State                  Protocol bit (Normative)  Bit value (Informative) 
   Operating state        Firmware Upgrade Protocol 0x00 00 20              
   Firmware Upgrade state Firmware Upgrade Active   0x00 00 10              

    

6.4 Data Transfer

  6.4.1 Streaming transfer

   If the Target Node, while in Firmware Upgrade state, sets the “Stream Protocol” bit in the Protocol
   Support Reply packet, then the Configuration Tool shall transfer the manufacturer-supplied firmware data
   by performing a Memory Configuration protocol Stream Write to the memory space of Firmware Space, with a
   starting offset of zero (0). The stream data bytes are the unmodified, uninterpreted, exact sequence of
   the manufacturer-supplied firmware upgrade file.

   The Target Node being upgraded may, but is not required to, throttle the incoming data on the stream by
   means allowed by the Stream protocol.

   After transferring all the bytes in the manufacturer-supplied firmware data file, the CT shall wait
   until it would be allowed to send more data according to the Stream protocol. Then the CT shall close
   the stream as defined in the Stream protocol. Afterwards the CT may, but is not required to, initiate a
   transition to Operating state.

  6.4.2 Datagram transfer

   If the Target Node, while in Firmware Upgrade state, doe not set the “Stream Protocol” bit in the
   Protocol Support Reply packet, the Configuration Tool shall transfer the manufacturer-supplied firmware
   data by performing a sequence of Memory Configuration protocol Write commands, starting at offset 0,
   with exactly 64 bytes of payload in each datagram except the last, and the datagrams' offsets increasing
   by 64 bytes after each. The concatenated payloads of the Write messages sent shall be are the
   unmodified, uninterpreted, exact sequence of the manufacturer-supplied firmware upgrade file.

   The Target Node being upgraded may, but is not required to, throttle the incoming data on the stream by
   means allowed by the Datagram protocol and Memory Configuration Protocol.

   After transferring all the bytes in the manufacturer-supplied firmware data file, the CT shall wait
   until the last datagram is responded to as the Memory Configuration Protocol requires. Afterwards the CT
   may, but is not required to, initiate a transition to Operating state.

  6.4.3 Aborting and Completing the transfer

   If the node being upgraded encounters an error, it may abort the data transfer by aborting the stream
   with an error code when using the Stream protocol, or, respectively, returning a Datagram Reject with an
   error code or a Write Response Failed Memory Configuration datagram. If the transfer is aborted, the
   node is required to stay in Firmware Upgrade state. If the CT re-tries the transfer, it shall do so from
   offset zero again. If the Target Node aborted the transfer, it is not required to be able to return to
   Operating state until the transfer is re-tried and successfully completed; however, it is required to be
   able to boot after a power cycle and return to Firmware Upgrade state, able to accept a new firmware
   upgrade attempt.

    

6.5 Full sequence of firmware upgrade

   For a more detailed description of the messages transferred, please see the Firmware Upgrade Technical
   Note.

    1. The CT sends a Memory Configuration datagram command “Freeze” with an argument of Firmware Space.
       Note that a Datagram Received OK reply message is not always returned to this request.

    2. The CT waits for a Node Initialization Complete message from the Target Node.

    3. The CT sends a Protocol Support Inquiry to the Target Node to check whether it supports Stream
       protocol.

    4. The CT performs the Data Transfer.

    5. The CT resets the Target Node using a Memory Configuration datagram command “Unfreeze” with an
       argument of Firmware Space.
