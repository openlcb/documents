                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This standard describes the format and allocation of OpenLCB 48-bit Unique Identifiers. It is not
   specific to any wire protocol.

                                                2 Intended Use

   Many OpenLCB protocols rely on each node having a Node ID, and those Node IDs being absolutely unique
   between nodes. OpenLCB defines 48-bit unique identifiers for this purpose. Unique Identifiers are also
   used to ensure that Event Identifiers are uniquely specified. This Standard is intended to ensure these
   Unique Identifiers are available. It applies to all OpenLCB uses of 48-bit Unique Identifiers, including
   as Node Identifiers.

                                    3 References and Context (Informative)

   This specification is in the context of the following OpenLCB Standards:

     * The Message Network Standard, which defines the basic messages and how they interact. Higher-level
       protocols are based on this message network, but are defined elsewhere.

     * The Event Identification Standard, which defines the well-known Events Identifiers.

                                                   4 Format

   An OpenLCB unique identifier (Unique ID) shall be six bytes of eight bits each.

   The order of bytes in an OpenLCB unique Identifier shall be considered significant. The most-significant
   byte shall be transmitted first during communication operations. The most-significant byte shall be
   written first (left-most in Western format) in any human-readable representation.  Within the tables
   below, byte 1 is considered the most-significant byte, while byte 6 is considered the least significant
   byte.

   An OpenLCB Unique Identifier shall include one or more 1 bits.

   Every OpenLCB node shall have a Unique Identifier to use as a Node Identifier (Node ID).

                                           5 Allocation (Normative)

   Unique identifiers shall be allocated using one of the mechanisms in this section.  When additional
   allocation methods are defined, the Unique Identifiers defined by those additional methods shall only
   provide allocation ranges that do no overlap with existing allocation ranges.  Ranges that are not
   explicitly allocated are reserved for future use unless otherwise noted within this document.

5.1 Overview

   Unique Identifiers are allocated in groups starting with the most significant byte as the macro group
   assignment.

5.5 Self-Assigning Groups

   These Unique Identifiers are assigned in association with an outside organizations unique identification
   scheme.  The outside organization is responsible for assigning a globally unique identifier that maps
   into the OpenLCB Unique Identifier space designated in the table below.  Future definition of ranges for
   additional groups will use unique values in Byte 2.

5.6 Assigned by Software at Runtime

   A program running in a computer with an IP address must not use that address to directly formulate a
   unique identifier. The program may use an IP connection to request a unique identifier from openlcb.org,
   or from another organization that is distributing unique identifiers from a range designated to it.

5.7 Specifically Assigned by Request

   These ranges are assigned by the OpenLCB organization.  Periodically, but not on a predetermined
   schedule, this document will be updated with any additionally assigned ranges.  The OpenLCB organization
   reserves the right to allocate additional Unique Identifiers out of this pool without updating this
   document, and a comprehensive list of specifically assigned Unique Identifiers is maintained in
   real-time on the OpenLCB Organization web site.  In the unlikely event that the OpenLCB organization
   website is in conflict with the latest officially adopted version of this document, the document
   represents the true allocation.

5.8 Locomotive Control Systems

   This Unique identifier range (starting with a most significant byte value of 0x06) was originally
   allocated for locomotive control systems.  These allocations are no longer valid, because locomotive
   control is being implemented differently than originally conceived.  For historical reasons, the values
   are displayed here.  Do not use these Unique Identifiers for any reason, as their use has been
   deprecated, and they may be re-designated for another purpose in the future.

5.9 RFID and NFC

   The RFID Unique Identifiers space is reserved for further standardization in the future.  Do not use
   this space before contacting the OpenLCB organization first.

5.10 Temporary Assigned by Software at Runtime

   A program running in a computer with an IP address must not use that address to directly formulate a
   unique identifier.  Furthermore, a program may dynamically allocate nodes who need a Unique Identifier
   assigned to them.  The program may use an IP connection, or another unspecified method, to request a
   unique identifier from openlcb.org, or from another organization that is distributing unique identifiers
   from a range designated to it.

   These Unique Identifiers are assigned on a leased basis.  A temporary (leased) Unique Identifier server
   will issue a Unique Identifier that is valid for a designated period of time.  When the lease period is
   up, the Unique Identifier server may re-issue the same Unique Identifier to another node as needed.  The
   Unique Identifier server and client can periodically negotiate an extension of the lease indefinitely.

5.11 Reserved Unique Identifiers

   All other unique identifiers not specifically discussed in this Standard shall not be used until the
   Standard is revised to permit their use.  Additionally, the following table identifies Unique
   Identifiers that shall be reserved indefinitely.
