                                                1 Introduction

   "Configuration description information" in this context refers to fixed information available from an
   OpenLCB device, via OpenLCB, so that other devices can properly and correctly configure it. The
   information is fixed, so that it can be pre-compressed, stored in the device, and just supplied when
   needed with minimal work on the part of the device and the device's developers. This means that e.g. the
   actual current configuration contents are not available as part of the CDI, as that is variable
   information. Similarly, the CDI cannot contain e.g. a serial number as that would require different CDI
   contents in each node of a single type.

    

   Other information may be available via e.g. manuals or the Internet, and there may be pointers to that
   information in the CDI, but the format of that information is not under specification here.

    

   A key use for CDI is to enable a Configuration Tool (CT) to know how to configure the node. The
   configuration tool will use the CDI information to render some form of suitable Graphical User Interface
   to allow the user to easily and intuitively configure all aspects of the node's capabilities. An
   important design choice was to embed the CDI into each node so that the system has all it needs to
   configure the node without having to source the information externally to the OpenLCB network from the
   manufacturer or some other on-line repository via the Internet or a CD/DVD etc. While the CT is likely
   to be a program running on a PC, it could be a hand-held device like mobile phone or PDA or even a
   custom-built device.

                                        2 Annotations to the Standard

2.1 Introduction

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

2.2 Intended Use

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

2.3 Reference and Context

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

   The Memory Configuration Protocol is one use for the CDI, and one way to retrieve it, but CDI is
   independent of that.

   CiA 306 “Electronic data sheet specification” describes the CANopen version of a similar capability.

2.4 Content

   “Initialized State” means talking on the OpenLCB, so CDI is fixed while you're up. But it can change
   when the node e.g. resets.

   The CDI information shall be constant.  A node may not change it after any part of it has been retrieved
   and before the next transition of the node away from the Initialized state.  (The transition back to
   Initialized stte tells other nodes to flush their caches and pick up any changed content)

2.5 Format

   May extend later for e.g. compression, via changes to the 1st character or some other method.

    

   The first byte is used to distinguish the coding.

   “<” (which is part of the XML “<?xml version='1.0'?>” definition): Uncoded characters

   UTF BOM: Various UniCode forms

   0x01 – tag for compressed.  One format defined for total start string of 0x0101. (If you want to use
   another format, decompress on board)

   (can't use 0x00 as lead, since that's the end-of-string indication)

    

   The schema at prototypes/xml/schema (better location?) is really the normative thing, because that's
   what we check for conformance testing.

    

   No requirement that you validate against the schema. But since the contents are normative, you have to
   obey the defaults, etc, for missing elements.

    

   By specifying XML 1.0 only, XInclude, XML Namespaces, XML Base, xml:id and other extensions have been
   excluded.

    

   Because the using node may not have external connections, XML features requiring those (Xinclude, schema
   default values, …) shall not be assumed to be present.

    

   OK to specify stylesheets (because the XML 1.0 standard is silent on that)

    

   OK to include XML comments

    

   Hexadecimal notation (0x1234) for numbers is not permitted. Although it may have made the CDI easier for
   people to read, the XML is primarily intended for consumption by OpenLCB nodes.  Providing optional
   coding, such as hexadecimal numbers, makes those nodes more complex.

    

                                     3 Stuff to be merged into the above

    

3.1 Environment of Proposal

  3.1.1 Requirements

     * Each node needs to carry enough context that a stand-alone configuration tool can provide a useful
       human interface without getting any data from an external source, e.g. needing an Internet download
       to handle a new node type. This allows a quality configuration experience to happen in a completely
       self-contained system.

     * Users want  to configure a node entirely over the OpenLCB, without physical interactions, e.g.
       pushing buttons.

  3.1.2 Preferences

     * Small nodes shouldn't need a lot of processing power, e.g. to compress or decompress data in real
       time. Memory usage should also be limited, but is a second priority.

     * Configuration retrieval operations should be state-less and idempotent to simplify software at both
       ends. This is a preference for the CDI retrieval mechanism, not the CDI itself.

     * Multiple independent configuration operations can proceed at the same time. Specifically, multiple
       devices should be able to retrieve correct configuration description information at the same time.
       This is a preference for the CDI retrieval mechanism, not the CDI itself.

  Design Points

   Basic configuration is done with the configuration protocol defined elsewhere.

   The “Variables” described here are not exactly the same thing as “Configuration Variables” (CVs) or
   “Node Variables” (NVs) that are discussed elsewhere. Those are aimed at storage, and so are grouped by
   address. The “Variables” here are grouped by function. “Long address” might be several CVs, but would be
   one variable to this proposal. Similarly, CV29 has lots of variables within it, each stored as bits.
   Perhaps it would be better to use a different name here, such as “Setting” or “Option”?

    

    

    

3.2 Proposal

    

  3.2.1 Definition

    

    

   2) The primary design constraints are complexity and size in the OpenLCB device providing CDI, and
   complexity and size in the device consuming the CDI.

    

   2A) Size and complexity in the providing device is the more important constraint. There are more of
   those devices, they are cost sensitive, and they may not be upgradable once delivered.

    

   2B) Size and complexity in the CDI-consuming device should also be considered. In particular, code
   complexity is an issue which must be addressed.

    

    

   3) Secondary constraints are testability of the provided information, scalability of the format, and the
   convenience and availability of a suitable toolchain.

    

    

   4) There is a physical/logical structure to the configuration which the CDI can and should reflect:

    

   4A) The basic OpenLCB unit is a "Node". Nodes provide CDI for their needed configuration information.
   The protocol for that will be defined elsewhere/elsewhen.

    

   4B) A Node can contain zero or more "Producers". Each Producer is independently configured. There is no
   ordering between separate Producers, but they can be numbered for ease of reference.

    

   4C) A Node can contain zero or more "Consumers". Each Consumer is independently configured. There is no
   ordering between separate Consumers, or between individual Consumers and Producers, but they can be
   numbered for ease of reference.

    

   4D) Each Producer or Consumer can be configured with zero or one Events.

    

   4E) Each Event has an Identifier which uniquely defines it. An event may optionally carry additional
   data.

    

   4F) To ensure future growth, there is no required "device", "channel" or other grouping within a node.
   Those may be present in some node types, and CDI must be able to represent them, but may not require any
   specific organization.

    

  3.2.2 Storage

   The configuration definition is stored in a hierarchical manner.

    

   I) In what follows:

    

   A "String" must be present; an "Optional String" does not have to be. Strings are in UTF-8.

    

   An "Integer" may be signed; if no sign, it's taken as positive.

    

   A "Map" provides a set of named descriptive values. It contains:

    

   Name: Optional String, if present required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Description: Optional String

   1 or more "Key", "Value" pairs. Each element of the pair can be of any supported type, depending only on
   how it is to be used.

   Map elements provide a mapping between the pairs they contain. For example, a map can relate numeric
   values for a variable to description strings. A map can also be used to provide free-form documentation
   when neither the key nor the value are specified in advance. It may be useful in the future to specify
   how maps can be defined at the group level to reduce duplication. Having the possibility of a “Name” is
   meant to ease that future effort.

    

   II) At the top, root level is the information for a "node". This includes:

    

   Manufacturer: String

   Descriptive Map: May contain “Model”, “Version”, “URL” and “Description” keys, along with any others
   desired.

    

   Model: If present, the human-readable model name the manufacturer gives to this node.

   Version: If present, the human-readable version string for the current board.

   Description: Optional String

   URL: If present, a URL for more information. No specific content is expected at the URL; If desired,
   that can be dealt with in a different specification.

    

   Any other information desired can be added via additional keys.

    

   III) Within the node is zero or more "groups". Each group contains:

    

   Name: String, required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Descriptive Map: Map of documentation information; the “Description” key is the basic item.

   Replication count: Integer >= 1 (number of times this group is replicated within the parent item)

    

   A group with a replication count > 1 (called a replicated group) can be used to represent a type of
   replicated device. For example, a node with 4 identical input devices and 6 identical output devices can
   be compactly described by two groups, with replication counts of 4 and 6 respectively.

    

   Individual groups within replicated groups are numbered from 1 to the replication count. If more than
   one replicated group is present, the numbering for each starts again with 1.

    

   Groups may contain one or more inner groups, with the same representation. This may continue to any
   desired level.

    

   IV) Groups may contain "variable", "producer" and/or "consumer" descriptions.

    

   IV-a) A "variable" description contains:

    

   Name: String, required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Type: Exactly one of "boolean", "digit" (an unsigned binary-coded-decimal value), "signed" (a binary
   value with a sign), "unsigned" (a binary value without a sign), "string" (a UTF-8 string, not-null
   terminated), or "blob" (arbitrary byte vector).

   Max: Integer - For string and blob variables, the maximum number of bytes that can be stored. For digit,
   signed and unsigned types, the maximum value allowed.

   Min: Integer - For digit, signed and unsigned values, the minimum value allowed.

   Description: Optional String

   Default: value of this Type, required

   Offset: Optional integer offset with in the configuration address space for this item; if not present,
   data is laid out by length in depth-first order.

    

   A variable may contain zero or one map descriptions. If present, the map represents a mapping between
   possible values (the "Key" part of the map's pairs) and convenient names for them (the "Value" part of
   the map's pairs).

    

   Note that the current value of a variable is not considered configuration definition information (see
   item 1A and 1B in the introduction).

    

   Configuration information must not be packed into variables; each variable must represent one type of
   information. In particular, the use of individual bits within larger values to pack multiple pieces of
   information is forbidden; those must be represented as individual variables. (How the information is
   stored internally is up to the designer of the specific device, and is not restricted; this requirement
   is about access to the information, not about how it's laid out in physical memory)

    

   IV-b) A "producer" description contains:

    

   Name: String, required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Description: Optional String

   Replication count: Integer >= 1 (number of times this producer definition is replicated within the
   parent item)

   Offset: Optional integer offset with in the configuration address space for this item; if not present,
   data is laid out by length in depth-first order.

    

   A producer description may contain zero or more variable descriptions for any variables that configure
   details of the producer's function.

    

   IV-c) A "consumer" description contains:

    

   Name: String, required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Description: Optional String

   Replication count: Integer >= 1 (number of times this consumer definition is replicated within the
   parent item)

   Offset: Optional integer offset with in the configuration address space for this item; if not present,
   data is laid out by length in depth-first order.

    

   A consumer description may contain zero or more variable descriptions for any variables that configure
   details of the consumer function. This may include e.g. variables that define how any content in
   incoming messages will be used.

  3.2.3 Serialization

   The logical layout in the previous section has to be converted to some serial set of bytes for transfer
   and storage.

   The primary format is straight-forward XML. (Link to schema)

   Another is compressed binary information. Either an aggressive compression algorithm, or some
   context-aware compression, can be used. Size and ease of expansion are the key criteria; ease of
   compression is much less important. XSLT can do some of the reformatting between compact and readable
   form

   We need to pick one format for a lingua franca.

3.3 Example

   The following is not meant to show how configuration definition information would be stored, but what
   kinds of information would be stored. It's a description of a complex accessory decoder, the Digitrax
   DS54, modified for use in a Producer-Consumer model.

    

   Hopefully the syntax will be self-explanatory. In any case, it's just for this example, not a proposal
   of any kind.

   Replication count (integer): 2

    

   Producer start:

   ...

   Map End

   ...

   Variable:

   Name: Input Task

   Type: Integer

   Max: 8

   Min: 0

   Default: 0

   Description: Specify the local action when this input is active

    

   Map:

   "1", "No output change"

   Description: Sets both output leads inactive.

   Consumer end:

    

   Group end: (This is end of the "Channel" group)

    

   Group end: (This is end of the "Decoder" group)

    

    

   Some thoughts based on putting this example together:

    

   1) In a real DS54, there are subtle differences between the Switch and Aux configuration choices on the
   various channels. I blurred those here by documenting them identically via replication. For a real
   device, they could either be separately specified or (more likely) the differences wouldn't matter in a
   P/C-based device.

    

   2) A DS54 can receive messages that put its output into four states: One side on, the other side on,
   both sides on, and neither side on. These four interacts with the "Output Type" setting in weird and
   wonderful ways. This was represented as four consumers. This seems a much more logical way to configure
   the device, as it gives more flexibility to the rest of the layout that's originating the requests.

    

   3) The DS54 inputs also generate messages. They are specified as two producers (for the active and
   inactive messages).

3.4 Implementation Notes

   This section is non-normative notes and suggestions for implementors.

   Some references for XML compression:

   http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-datacompression/index.html?cmp=dw&cpb=dwxml&ct=dwnew&cr=dwnen&ccy=zz&csr=072111

   http://www.cs.panam.edu/~artem/main/teaching/csci6370spring2011/papers/XML%20compression%20techniques%20A%20survey%20and%20comparison.pdf

   On the other hand, a look-back compression algorithm has the advantage that it's cheap to decompress and
   might do almost as well:

   http://excamera.com/sphinx/article-compression.html

   XML strings can start with a UTF BOM (either 0xEF, 0xFF or 0xFE in the 1st byte, since there's no need
   to support UTF-32BE or UTF-32LE), or the UTF-8 text for “<?xml” which starts with 0x3C. (But concern
   about support for too many character sets!)

   A first byte of 0x80 is defined as the “Compressed” indicator(s), followed by a byte that indicates the
   compression type.  (We don't want to have too many kinds, as receivers need to implement all of them to
   be able to use the CDI!)  0x80 00 is the code for our choice of default, see
   http://excamera.com/sphinx/article-compression.html

                                              4 Remaining items

   Internationalization of the XML content?

   Talk about the encoding string in the <?xml first line, and UTF-8 coding as default; ASCII as subset.

    

   Mini-XML effort; we're using as simple a subset as possible.
