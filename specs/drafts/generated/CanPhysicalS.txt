                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This document defines the physical layer for carrying OpenLCB-CAN over a single Controller Area Network
   (CAN) bus. It it not otherwise normative.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Conforming OpenLCB CAN nodes can be connected by cables to form a linear CAN bus with optional short
   stubs.  OpenLCB CAN nodes generally have two RJ45 modular connectors and can be daisy-chained together
   with suitable computer-network (“Ethernet”) cables. A CAN terminator is installed by the user at each
   end of the main bus.

   A limited amount of power can be distributed via the cable, allowing a few nodes to draw their power
   from a nearby (less than 20 ft / 6m) source attached to the common bus.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   In this document

     * “RJ45” refers to the miniature 8 position unkeyed plug and jack defined in sections Section 6.1.1.3
        and Section 6.1.1.4, respectively, of the TIA-968-A specification.

     * “UTP” refers to CAT-3 or better cable as defined in TIA/EIA-568-B or the successor TIA/EIA- 568-C.
       This specifically includes CAT-5e cable.

     * “CAN” refers to the electrical and protocol specifications as defined in ISO 11898-1:2003 and ISO
       11898-2:2003 and their successors.

   External certification of parts shall be accepted for conformance to these standards. Conformance with a
   later version of a standard shall be accepted as conformance with the referenced versions.

                                    4 Physical Interconnection (Normative)

   CAN connections between nodes shall be made using UTP cable. There shall be a RJ45 plug on the cable and
   RJ45 jack on the node unless the cable is permanently attached to the node.

    

   The signal, conductor and pair assignments shall be:

   Cables, including cables attached to nodes, shall carry conductors 1 & 2 as a pair, and conductors 3 & 6
   as a pair.

   Cables may, but are not required to, carry conductors 4 and 5. Conductors 4 and 5, if present, shall be
   carried as a pair.

   Cables may, but are not required to, carry conductors 7 and 8. Conductors 7 and 8, if present, shall be
   carried as a pair.

   If a node provides two or more connections, conductors 1 through 8 shall be provided on all connections.
   Conductors 1 through 7 shall be connected in parallel on all connections. If the node does not provide
   power on pin 8 on all connectors, pin 8 on all connectors shall be connected in parallel. All wiring
   discussed in this paragraph shall be rated to carry at least 1A.

   Nodes shall connect conductors 3 and 6 . This connection shall be rated to carry at least 1A.

   A node may, but is not required to, connect conductor 7 with conductors 3 and 6. Nodes that require
   conductor 7 to be connected to conductors 3 and 6 for proper operation shall connect conductor 7 to
   conductors 3 and 6.

   Voltages of up to 100 volts AC or either polarity DC on the reserved conductors 4 and 5 shall not damage
   the node nor prevent normal operation of the node.

   Voltages of up to 27 volts AC or either polarity DC on the PWR_NEG / PWR_POS conductors shall not
   permanently damage the node.

                                         5 Data Transport (Normative)

   Data shall be transferred using a CAN signal at 125kbps and CAN frame protocol.

   Any devices providing bus termination shall conform to CAN requirements for that termination.

   A node may, but is not required to, provide a method for bus termination as part of the node. If so,
   there shall be a user-accessible method for enabling and disabling the termination, and the node shall
   be shipped from the original manufacturer with the termination disabled.

                                        6 Supply of Power (Normative)

   A node may, but is not required to, provide power to the cable PWR_POS / PWR_NEG conductors.

   If a node provides power, it shall provide at least 9VDC and no more than 15VDC from zero current draw
   up to its specified maximum current. Its specified maximum current shall not exceed 500 mA. The
   specified maximum current shall be permanently written on the node in a location visible to the user.
   This label is required whether or not the node provides power to the cable.  

                                      7 Consumption of Power (Normative)

   Nodes may, but are not required to, draw power from the PWR_POS / PWR_NEG conductors in the cable.
    Nodes shall not draw more than 500 mA at any PWR_POS / PWR_NEG voltage from 7.5VDC to 15VDC.  Nodes
   that draw power shall operate properly with a supply voltage of 7.5VDC to 15VDC on the PWR_POS / PWR_NEG
   conductors. The maximum current drawn by each node shall be permanently written on that node in a
   location visible to the user. This label is required whether or not the node draws power from the cable.
