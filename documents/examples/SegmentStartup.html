<H1>OpenLCB Example: CAN Segment Startup</H1>
<P>OpenLCB nodes on a CAN segment emit and receive a number of frames
during startup of the segment. This is an example calculation of the
number of messages and how long it takes. 
</P>
<P>See also the &quot;<A HREF="../notes/MessageTypesForSimpleNodes.html">Messages
Types for Simple Nodes</A>&quot; note. 
</P>
<H2>Message Counts</H2>
<P>A simple CAN node, in the typical case (no contention, no
non-unique MUIDs, etc) will generate the following messages at
startup: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">6 CIM messages while allocating a
	alias 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">1 RIM message at the end of the
	allocation 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">1 Initialization Complete message
	at the end of initialization 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Npc Producer/Consumer Indentified messages for events of
	interest 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2>Example</H2>
<P>Assume a segment of 100 simple nodes, each producing or consuming
32 events (Npc = 32). 
</P>
<P>Then a total of 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">  100 * (8+32) = 4000 messages</PRE><P>
will be emitted at startup. 
</P>
<P>An extended-header CAN frame is 65 bit times plus data content.
Assuming (for now) 8-byte data contents, this is approximately
4000*16*8 = 512,000 bits, or about 4 seconds at 125kbps. 
</P>
<P>CAN is very good at contention management, so it's quite capable
of reaching (close to) 100% utilization for something like this.
Therefore, each node will be presented with those 4000 packets at
about 1000 packets per second during startup. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Routing/Gateway nodes need to be able
to handle the full rate. They don't have to forward the RIM/CIM
frames off the segment, so the bandwidth requirements are a little
less, but they still have to process those to keep an alias table.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Simple nodes that only act on P/C
messages need only listen to the CIM/RIM messages at the beginning.
