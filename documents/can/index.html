<H1>CAN Wire Protocol</H1>
<P>CAN bus (ISO 11989-*) provides a very convenient transport medium
for OpenLCB on a specific module or layout. This section defines a
specific wire protocol for transporting OpenLCB over CAN bus. 
</P>
<P>Common OpenLCB messages need to be translated for transport via
CAN 2.0B frames because of the limited CAN frame sizes and to take
advantage of CAN interface features such as filtering on the header
bits. 
</P>
<P>The adaptations include 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A 1-bit priority field has been
	added to provide a coarse high/low message priority 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">NID values are translated to 12
	bit forms. Those forms are dynamically allocated so as to remain
	unique. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Remapping of MTI values to make limited filtering possible. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Note that these adaptions must be possible in standard CAN
components, e.g. bridges and computer adapters must not require
customization to operate with OpenLCB. This provides a stringent
requirement on protocol design, in that OpenLCB CAN cannot require
specific timing, deliberate creation of error cases or specific error
handling. 
</P>
<H2>Physical Layer</H2>
<P>The physical layer of OpenLCB-CAN is 125kbps CAN over twisted pair
wiring.  The NMRA is attempting to define a common physical layer for
use across multiple implementations, and that may in turn define the
physical layer of OpenLCB-CAN.</P>
<P>For more information, see the separate 
<a href="CommonPlatform.html">Common CAN Platform</a>
document.</P>
<H2>Link Layer</H2>
<P>OpenLCB common messages are converted, to the extent possible, to
single CAN frames via a one-to-one mapping. 
</P>
<P>The translations include: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The NID Source ID (SID) is mapped to a shorter form, called a
	&quot;NID Alias&quot; (NIDa). The method for this mapping is defined
	such that devices on the CAN segment (e.g. gateways to other parts
	of the larger OpenLCB installation) can determine the full NID that
	corresponds to a particular alias. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Because this alias is still unique on
	the specific CAN segment, it is used in the CAN header for
	arbitration. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">MTIs may have to be shortened,
	depending on bit allocations. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>When possible, Destination NIDs are also mapped to the
	shorter form. In some OpenLCB messages, this is not possible, in
	which case the full NID form is sent; a bit is provided to indicate
	which format is carried. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Design decisions:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The CAN format has been allocated
	on nibble boundaries to make it easier to e.g. read dumps of
	packets. The header is considered to be right (LSB) aligned.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A specific mapping from the common
	16-bit MTI format to a shorter CAN format is documented in a
	<A HREF="../MtiAllocations.ods">separate worksheet</A> (<A HREF="../MtiAllocations.pdf">PDF
	version</A>). The common form is 16 bits to have lots of space to
	grow at the high end, but it can be mapped into a 8 bit field for
	efficient CAN transfer. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Nodes must handle full rate
	messages, specifically including messages not addressed to them.
	(The datagram and stream protocols provide ways for nodes to
	indicate whether or not they have sufficient buffering for the next
	transmission, triggering retries as needed) For long term
	reliability, a node <U>must</U> be able to completely process an
	entire CAN frame in the time it takes to receive the next one, which
	may be as little as 64 bit times, or about 500 microseconds.</P>
	<LI><P>A 1-bit field priority field coarsely specifies the priority
	of the message in terms of CAN arbitration to be high (pri=0) or low
	(pri=1). By default, all messages are to be emitted with low
	priority selected. Receiving nodes must not check this bit.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This field is intended for network
	infrastructure and server type nodes (Command Stations) that may
	from time to time experience high traffic loads and need the ability
	to pre-empt other nodes to forward messages from a busy segment or
	preempt the sending of responses to nodes over receiving new
	requests to prevent message buffer overflow. This field is separate
	from the static priority field in the MTI format specification.</P>
	<LI><P>Designers may wish to use CAN hardware filtering, but it
	can't be assumed to be present. We assign a single bit to indicate
	“simple node protocol” messages to make simple filtering
	possible.</P>
</UL>
<P>Header content and sizes (Nominal decisions shown, 29 bit header):
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Priority bit (Always sent as 1
	now; at front to ensure it acts like a true priority; 0 for high
	priority, 1 for low; not checked by receivers)

<H3>Throughput and Temporarily Deaf Nodes</H3>
<P>OpenLCB requires that CAN-attached nodes be able to handle the
full frame rate on the CAN bus. There is no guarantee that frames for
a given node will arrive with non-zero time between then. 
</P>
<P>Some nodes are not always able to process frames. For example, the
node may cease processing for a short time while writing non-volatile
memory. Higher-level protocols, e.g. configuration write datagrams,
have mechanisms built in to prevent overrun while writing
configuration memory, but there could be multiple activities going on
in parallel that will result in frames arriving while the node is not
processing.</P>
<P>Short outages can be covered by CAN hardware buffering, so long as
the node will eventually catch up even at full arrival rate. Outages
long enough that frames are lost due to e.g. buffer overflow require
node to broadcast that it's back up if hardware detected frame lost.
This is because tehre could have been frames of some form that
modified the OpenLCB node state, which are now lost (e.g. drop alias,
CIM/RIM in absence, or even higher level events) 
</P>

<H3>CANid assignment</H3>
<P>The common message format uses full 48-bit node ID numbers to
identify originating nodes and in some case destination nodes. CAN
frames use 12-bit local &quot;NID alias&quot; for these to save space
in the limited-size CAN payload. 
</P>
<P>The standard Verify Node ID Number interaction can be used to get
the full 48-bit NID from a node for translation. At power up each
node must obtain a alias that is locally unique. Gateways will also
have to obtain unique aliases for remote nodes they are proxying on
to the segment.

	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Send CAN frames claiming that

	section of the header.

<P>Note that there is no requirement that this alias be consistent
from one run to the next. More detail is on a <A HREF="CanIDAllocation.html">separate

<H2>
Translation</H2>
<P>A node must be able to convert traffic on the local CAN segment
into the common message format using only locally available
information. This may be needed e.g. by a gateway or monitoring
program attached to the CAN segment. 
</P>
<P>All traffic on a CAN segment uses aliases for both Source ID
(always) and Destination ID (when the full NID isn't known). 
</P>
<P>If/when a full NID is needed, it can be obtained by sending a
&quot;Verify Node ID Number (Addressed)&quot; message with an
appropriate Destination Node ID in local alias form. The reply will
eventually come back with the Source ID in local alias form and
carrying the full NID in the message content. 
</P>
<P>Aliases for nodes on the local segment are only valid until an
&quot;Initialization Complete&quot; is seen from that alias.
Initialization Complete indicates that a node has restarted, and may
have another local alias. 
</P>
<P>Gateways maintain the mapping between remote node's NID and local
alias. If they need to break that mapping, e.g. because they need to
reuse the local alias due to resource limitations in the mapping
tables, they must send a &quot;Mapping Reset&quot; message to force
nodes to drop their alias information. <I>&quot;Mapping Reset&quot;
is a CAN-specific message limited to the segment, but all gateways on
the segment must act on it.</I> 
</P>
<P>Gateways may not be able ensure permanent validity for alias to
remote NIDs. For example, if they have a limited routing table, they
may need to reuse local alias. Before reusing them, they have to send
a &quot;Mapping Reset&quot; frame to drop references to the old NID,
followed by a &quot;Initialization Complete&quot; when the alias is
allocated to a new NID. 
</P>
<H3>Map Acquisition</H3>
<P><A NAME="todo"></A>In order to acquire the map between CANids and
NIDs, a gateway needs to be able to send a CAN frame requiring
&quot;everybody reply with your NID&quot;. Much like Ethernet gateway
mapping, this needs to return the NID of just the specific
CAN-attached hardware, not all the NIDs that can be e.g. reached
through a gateway, so it needs to be a segment-specific message
defined only at the CAN level. It must not be a OpenLCB common
message. 
</P>
<H2>OpenLCB message format</H2>
<P>OpenLCB common messages are carried in frames with a 1 in the
Frame Type field. They contain message type information and/or
address information in the 15-bit variable field, and zero to eight
CAN data bytes.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">For OpenLCB messages, the variable
field is used in three forms:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">Unaddressed messages – messages
	that don't have a destination address put the low 12 bits of the MTI
	in the variable field</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">Addressed messages – messages
	that have a specific destination address put it in the variable
	field, and carry the MTI in the payload. This allows filtering.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">Stream addressed messages – as a
	special case to improve efficiency of transfer, the streaming
	protocol uses 12 bits of the variable field to identify a particular
	stream transfer. This is not the same as a destination NodeID alias,
	but performs a similar function to allow filtering while also
	allowing multiple streams from a source.</P>
