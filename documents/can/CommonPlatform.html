<H1>Common CAN Platform</H1>
<P>At the NMRA 2010 meeting in Milwaukee, it was tentatively agreed
to work toward a “common platform” definition that manufacturers
could use to create boards with reduced uncertainty as to whether
they'd be usable in the future. This has now resulted in a proposed
NMRA 9.x.1 
<a href="../../srpdrafts/NMRA_S-9-x-1.pdf">Standard</a>
and 
<a href="../../srpdrafts/NMRA_TN-9-x-1.pdf">Technical Note</a>,
which the NMRA may or may not
decide to adopt at some time in the future. For more information, see
the 
<a href="../../srpdrafts/index.html">OpenLCB page on NMRA standards<a/>.</P>
<P>This page provided some background information during that
discussion.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Communications Physical Layer</H2>
<P>All groups have chosen Controller Area Network (CAN, reference
e.g. ISO 11898-2:2003) at 125kbps as a communications fabric. This
rate was generally chosen to be 125kbps to balance length and loading
(see the <A HREF="Background.html">CAN background document</A>).</P>
<P>A common platform standard should require support for that,
including proper slew-rate limitation.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The rise/fall time of CAN signals
	is a controllable parameter. The MCP2551 transceiver part used in
	e.g. MERG CBUS controls this with an Rs external resistor, by
	default a zero-Ohm jumper. According to Figure 1-1 of the MCP2551
	datasheet, this corresponds to a slope of above 25V/usec. Mike
	Bolton recommended in September 2009 that future designs use a 100k
	resistor instead to give a better waveform shape at 125kbps by
	limiting the slope to just under 5V/usec. This effects the maximum
	possible stub connection length, see SLLA270 page 9. We agree with
	this decision. That should be part of the final OpenLCB-CAN
	specification, along with suitable +/- limits on the quantity.</P>
</UL>
<P>CAN requires cable termination, but there doesn't seem to be a
need to require any particular kind of termination beyond considering
it when deciding on connectors.</P>
<P>CAN does not specify cabling, connectors, grounding nor power. The
first three are so intimately connected that we consider them
together below, followed by power considerations.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Cabling, Connectors and Grounding.</H3>
<P>Full length CAN runs require twisted pair cabling. At all lengths,
the polarity matters. 
</P>
<UL>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">CBUS uses a wiring
		recommendation, instead of specifying a connector. The 2009 CBUS
		cards use a captive-screw connector, allowing connection of
		CANH/CANL, ground, and several different power voltages. A
		recommendation is emerging to use the center pair of CAT5 cable
		(blue for CANH, white/blue for CANL). Ground is generally needed to
		avoid excessive common-mode voltage.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">LEDuino rev B/C has a 4 pin
		header, carrying +5V, CanH, CanL, Ground (later versions might
		change this). 
		</P>
	</UL>
</UL>
<P>The polarity requirement immediately rules out the use of the flat
telephone cables commonly found in existing layout control buses:
Flat telephone cable isn't twisted, and can be either cross-over or
straight-through (which causes much confusion due to different
requirements of different DCC vendors). Use of RJ25/RJ14/RJ11 plugs
makes it much too easy to use those kinds of cables, which rules out
those plugs.</P>
<P>There seem to be two primary approaches to wiring:</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Ad-hoc wiring and terminal strips</H4>
<P>Model railroaders are generally used to connecting wires with
terminal strips, and a 3-wire or 4-wire (see power section) terminal
block on the board could be used for CAN.</P>
<P>To get long CAN buses, though, twisted pair wiring with the proper
impedance must be used, and that is not always available in bulk at
the local store. Hand-twisted wire is very unlikely to be the proper
impedance, which will reduce the length and number of nodes which
work reliably. And the connectors are certainly not the proper
impedance, which means that each node has a larger impact on the bus
&amp; reduces the number of nodes that can work reliably.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">RJ45 connectors and associated cables</H4>
<P>RJ45 connectors and twisted pair cables are another choice. These
are sometimes called “Ethernet”, “Cat-5” or other names; CAN
only needs Cat-3, so we'll call these “Ethernet cables” here.</P>
<P>Ethernet cables and connectors have the proper impedance and
minimal loss for both the cable and connectors. They are the best way
to ensure that model railroaders routinely can build full-length CAN
buses. 
</P>
<P>Pre-made “Ethernet” cables are quite cheap. Five foot ones are
now available in single quantity for less than $1.50; 25 foot ones
for less than $5 in single quantity. The board connectors are about
$0.70 each, which does add some cost, but must be compared to cost of
other connectors. 
</P>
<P>On the other hand, adding connectors to Ethernet cable (e.g.
making your own from bulk cable) requires special tools and some
skill. It's easy to mess that up. 
</P>
<P>RJ45 jacks can carry four pair (usually orange, blue, green and
brown; there are two common ways of connecting wires to pins). Many
cheap Ethernet cables contain only the green and orange pairs,
connected to pins 1,2 and 3,6 (with two different color codes). The
CBUS choice of the blue (center) pair makes it difficult to combine a
“RJ45” and “terminal block” recommendation, as not all
Ethernet cables contain it. The existance of two different color
codes in the cables also adds confusion, because a decision to use a
specific pair (e.g. 1,2 or 3,6) might result in either green or
orange being the right colors at the other end.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Power</H3>
<P>Long CAN buses require that boards have some common system ground,
at least for the CAN receivers, to avoid excessive common mode. It
seems most reliable to carry that in the CAN cable as a 3<SUP>rd</SUP>
conductor. 
</P>
<P>(Should say some words about isolating that ground from other
parts of the system, e.g. the use of isolation in the CAN receivers?)</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">CAN isolation generally requires power
in the CAN bus. It's also convenient to carry board power, if not
load power, in the cable. Doing this in a standard requires
specifying a voltage range, and a current limit, in terms that are
useful to a model railroader.</P>
<UL>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">CAT5e
		connectors are limited to 1.5A (some are 1A), but the 24ga wire is
		the bigger problem for power distribution as it's 0.0480 ohms per
		foot, or 1 volt drop per 20 feet (one way) at 1A. Use three wires
		ground, three wires power to reduce drop? On board power convertors
		from a higher AC voltage?</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Board Characteristics</H2>
<P>Boards should have a bootloader so that users can load new code
without custom hardware tools. This might be either over a USB
connection (if the board has one; it's not required that the board
does) or over CAN. Since different CPU vendors are likely to provide
different boot-loaders, there's little point in trying to define a
common one. It would be good if CAN-based boot-loaders could be used
without uncabling the board, either by use of jumpers or some form of
addressing (button push?) and non-interfering CAN frames (standard
header?).</P>
<P>There are too many CPU families and specific chips out there to
say anything specific about memory sizes and CPU speeds. It wouldn't
hurt to remind manufacturers that a few pennies spent on either a CPU
socket or extra flash/RAM/EEPROM may extend the useful live of the
product.</P>
<P>Different proposals have different basic I/O needs. For example,
it would be better to have two LEDs and two buttons (plus reset) for
OpenLCB, while CBUS would prefer one button (reset?) and an 8-wide
DIP switch. (Have S9.5 schematics been posted anywhere?) Could a
least common denominator approach work here, with boards recommended
to have all these patterned on the board, and selectively stuffed as
needed? Or is that just trying to be too tricky?</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Setting User Expectations</H2>
<P>Wiring and connectors interacts with how many boards you can have,
total length, etc. A key part of this is setting user expectations.
This section is about what are reasonable expectations to set.</P>

<P>Subject: Electrical properties (was Re: [mergcbus] Re: New 12V
CBUS modules</P>
<P>My experience in this area is mostly from trying to make large,
long 250kbps CAN backbones reliable for the ad-hoc assemblies we use
for physics experiments. What usually happens is that bus works with
decreasing noise margin until &quot;one last thing&quot; is added, at
which point it's no longer working well at all. Sometimes, that
happens when somebody attempts to length the bus to reach &quot;just
one last crate&quot;, sometimes it happens when &quot;just one last
board&quot; is inserted into the middle.</P>
<P>There's a triple trade-off with CAN, once rate &amp; transceiver
properties are selected: You can have a lot of nodes, or you can
cover a long distance, or you can have useful stubs &amp; close
nodes. You can even (sometimes) have two of those. But you can't max
out all three of those at once.</P>
<P>In particular, if you have a long bus, the arrangement of distant
nodes (node capacitance, stubs, spacing) as well as cable properties
will be significant. If you want to get to 500m length (c.f.
http://www.merg.org.uk/resources/lcb.html), then you're dealing with
a round-trip propagation time of 5.6usec with high-quality cable
(even more with &quot;I twist it myself&quot; stuff). That's
comparable to the 125kHz settle time of 8-1.2 = 6.8usec. That means
that the bus is using &quot;initial wave signaling&quot;, because
there's no time for the transmitter to interact with the reflected
wave and get that back to the receiver. And that, in turn, means that
near-by impedance mismatches at the remote end can matter a lot.</P>
<P>For short networks, this doesn't matter. Nor does it usually
matter when the only communications are between near-by nodes on long
networks (you can get spurious errors there, but they're usually easy
to track down). But I think it'll matter a lot if you e.g. have a
bunch of nodes at one spot, and then run a long cable around with
some stubs on it for throttles to plug in.</P>
<P>How short is short? How many is many? Based on the rules of thumb
at LBNL/SLAC, which in turn came from much experience, 100 m / 25
nodes / no stubs over 3m / no cables under 1m works reliably. (Since
that is 250kpbs, you could probably add a general factor of two to
the length (200m), and perhaps to stub length.) We've relaxed every
one of those limits by as much as a factor of two, but only one at a
time, and often with difficulty. We too-often ran into trouble when
pushing more than that, to the point that we don't intentionally do
it anymore. For example, trying to run a single CAN link between two
rack groups 50m apart (probably 60m of cable), with 11 closely-spaced
(1ft) nodes in a group at one end and 13 in a group at the other, was
a complete failure until we put 1m cables between the nodes: they
could talk to their neighbors, but not to the remote end. In that
case, lowering the rate to 125kbps actually made the problem worse.
The eye scope showed that the composite reflection was huge mess, so
big it resulted in false rejections of frames.</P>
<P>Because getting the very most out of CAN is complicated, it's hard
to know how to set user expectations. Simple ones like &quot;allows
lengths of up to 500 metres&quot;, &quot;Currently available
transceivers set a limit to the number of nodes on a bus segment to
110&quot; and &quot;used spurs of 3m for the CABs and various bits of
wire for the bus with no problem&quot; are all certainly true. But
they're certainly _not_ all true at the same time.</P>
<P>It's up to other people than me to set user expectations for CBUS,
but one simple method that might be considered is:</P>
<P>*) Total cable length of 400m</P>
<P>*) Stubs count double in the total</P>
<P>*) Nodes count as 3m in the total (depends on connector
capacitance, etc)</P>
<P>*) Never less than 0.5m between nodes, nor between a stub
connection and a node.</P>
<P>(Depending on connectors in use for throttle jacks, you might want
to space &amp; count them too, as they carry some capacitance)</P>
<P>This is a little conservative, but since model railroaders tend to
just expand things until they fail, that's not a bad position to be
in.</P>
<P>In any case, my original post was just to mention that, in
addition to total cable length, total node count, and transmission
effects of stubs, the impedance effects of short interconnects is
something to keep an eye on. People can do with that as they will.</P>

<P>(The above email didn't discuss connectors; the LBL/SLAC
experience is with DeviceNet “thin round” cabling and mini
connectors, e.g. really solid impedance and contact resistance
control.</P>
