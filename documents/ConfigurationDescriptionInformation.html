<H1>OpenLCB: Configuration Description Information</H1>
<P>This is a working note in which we are developing recommendations
for “Configuration Description Information” (CDI).</P>
<P>Text from initial report to NMRAn<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">et
WG (</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>TN-9-6-NMRANET-Overview-Draft)</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="LucidaGrande"><FONT SIZE=3>:</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">“All NMRAnet nodes will contain a
compressed XML document that contains all the relevant information
for an external Configuration Tool (CT) to be able to to use to know
how to configure the node. It is expected that the CT will use the
data in the XML file to render some form of suitable Graphical User
Interface to allow the user to easily and intuitively configure all
aspects of the node's capabilities. An important design choice was to
embed this XML document into each node so that the system has all it
needs to configure the node without having to source the XML file
externally to the NMRAnet from the manufacturer or some other on-line
repository via the Internet or a CD/DVD etc. While the CT is likely
to be a program running on a PC, it could be a hand-held device like
mobile phone or PDA or even a custom built CT.”</P>
<H2>Environment of Proposal</H2>
<H3>Requirements</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Nodes must carry enough context that a stand-alone
	configuration tool can provide a useful human interface without
	getting any data from an external source, e.g. needing an Internet
	download to handle a new node type.</P>
	<LI><P>It must be possible to configure a node entirely over the
	OpenLCB, without physical interactions, e.g. pushing buttons.</P>
	<LI><P></P>
</UL>
<H3>Preferences</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Small nodes shouldn't need a lot of processing power, e.g. to
	compress or decompress data in real time. Memory usage should also
	be limited, but is a second priority.</P>
	<LI><P>Configuration operations should be state-less and idempotent
	to simplify software at both ends.</P>
	<LI><P>Multiple independent configuration operations can proceed at
	the same time. Specifically, multiple devices should be able to
	retrieve correct configuration description information at the same
	time.</P>
</UL>
<H3>Design Points</H3>
<P>Basic configuration is done with the <A HREF="MemoryConfigurationProtocol.html">configuration
protocol</A> defined elsewhere. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The “Variables” described here are
not exactly the same thing as “Configuration Variables” (CVs) or
“Node Variables” (NVs) that are discussed elsewhere. Those are
aimed at storage, and so are grouped by address. The “Variables”
here are grouped by function. “Long address” might be several
CVs, but would be one variable to this proposal. Similarly, CV29 has
lots of variables within it, each stored as bits. Perhaps it would be
better to use a different name here, such as “Setting” or
“Option”?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<H2>Proposal</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P>Some of the following is taken from Bob's note to the NMRAnet
Working Group list.</P>
<H3>Definition</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">1) &quot;Configuration description
information&quot; in this context refers to <U>fixed</U> information
available from a NMRAnet device, via NMRAnet, so that other devices
can properly and correctly configure it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">1A) The information is fixed, so that
it can be pre-compressed, stored in the device, and just supplied
when needed with minimal work on the part of the device and the
device's developers.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">1B) This means that e.g. the actual
current configuration contents are not available as part of the CDI,
as that is variable information. Similarly, the CDI cannot contain
e.g. a serial number as that would require different CDI contents in
each node of a single type.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">1C) Other information may be available
via e.g. manuals or the Internet, and there may be pointers to that
information in the CDI, but the format of that information is not
under specification here.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">2) The primary design constraints are
complexity and size in the NMRAnet device providing CDI, and
complexity and size in the device consuming the CDI.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">2A) Size and complexity in the
providing device is the more important constraint. There are more of
those devices, they are cost sensitive, and they may not be
upgradable once delivered.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">2B) Size and complexity in the
CDI-consuming device should also be considered. In particular, code
complexity is an issue which must be addressed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">3) Secondary constraints are
testability of the provided information, scalability of the format,
and the convenience and availability of a suitable toolchain.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">4) There is a physical/logical
structure to the configuration which the CDI can and should reflect:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">4A) The basic NMRAnet unit is a &quot;Node&quot;.
Nodes provide CDI for their needed configuration information. The
protocol for that will be defined elsewhere/elsewhen.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">4B) A Node can contain zero or more
&quot;Producers&quot;. Each Producer is independently configured.
There is no ordering between separate Producers, but they can be
numbered for ease of reference.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">4C) A Node can contain zero or more
&quot;Consumers&quot;. Each Consumer is independently configured.
There is no ordering between separate Consumers, or between
individual Consumers and Producers, but they can be numbered for ease
of reference.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">4D) Each Producer or Consumer can be
configured with zero or one Events.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">4E) Each Event has an Identifier which
uniquely defines it. An event may optionally carry additional data.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">4F) To ensure future growth, there is
no required &quot;device&quot;, &quot;channel&quot; or other grouping
within a node. Those may be present in some node types, and CDI must
be able to represent them, but may not require any specific
organization.</P>
<H3>Storage</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The configuration definition is stored
in a hierarchical manner.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I) In what follows:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A &quot;String&quot; must be present;
an &quot;Optional String&quot; does not have to be. Strings can be
either in ASCII (8-bit) or, to allow international use, UTF-8 or
UTF-16.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">An &quot;Integer&quot; may be signed;
if no sign, it's taken as positive.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A &quot;Map&quot; provides a set of
named descriptive values. It contains:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Name: Optional
String, if present required to be unique within enclosing group or
node</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Description: Optional
String</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">1 or more &quot;Key&quot;,
&quot;Value&quot; pairs. Each element of the pair can be of any
supported type, depending only on how it is to be used.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Map elements provide a mapping between
the pairs they contain. For example, a map can relate numeric values
for a variable to description strings. A map can also be used to
provide free-form documentation when neither the key nor the value
are specified in advance. It may be useful in the future to specify
how maps can be defined at the group level to reduce duplication.
Having the possibility of a “Name” is meant to ease that future
effort.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">II) At the top, root level is the
information for a &quot;node&quot;. This includes:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Manufacturer: String</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Descriptive Map: May contain “Model”,
“Version”, “URL” and “Description” keys, along with any
others desired.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Model: If present, the human-readable
model name the manufacturer gives to this node.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Version: If present, the human-readable
version string for the current board.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Description: Optional String</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">URL: If present, a URL for more
information. No specific content is expected at the URL; If desired,
that can be dealt with in a different specification.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Any other information desired can be
added via additional keys.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">III) Within the node is zero or more
&quot;groups&quot;. Each group contains:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Name: String, required to be unique
within enclosing group or node</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Descriptive Map:  Map of documentation
information; the “Description” key is the basic item.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Replication count: Integer &gt;= 1
(number of times this group is replicated within the parent item)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A group with a replication count &gt; 1
(called a replicated group) can be used to represent a type of
replicated device. For example, a node with 4 identical input devices
and 6 identical output devices can be compactly described by two
groups, with replication counts of 4 and 6 respectively.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Individual groups within replicated
groups are numbered from 1 to the replication count. If more than one
replicated group is present, the numbering for each starts again with
1.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Groups may contain one or more inner
groups, with the same representation. This may continue to any
desired level.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">IV) Groups may contain &quot;variable&quot;,
&quot;producer&quot; and/or &quot;consumer&quot; descriptions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">IV-a) A &quot;variable&quot;
description contains:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Name: String, required to be unique
within enclosing group or node</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Type: Exactly one of &quot;boolean&quot;,
&quot;digit&quot; (an unsigned binary-coded-decimal value), &quot;signed&quot;
(a binary value with a sign), &quot;unsigned&quot; (a binary value
without a sign), &quot;string&quot; (an ASCII string, not-null
terminated), or &quot;blob&quot; (arbitrary byte vector).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Max: Integer - For string and blob
variables, the maximum number of bytes that can be stored. For digit,
signed and unsigned types, the maximum value allowed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Min: Integer - For digit, signed and
unsigned values, the minimum value allowed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Description: Optional String</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Default: value of this Type, required</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Offset: Optional integer offset with in
the configuration address space for this item; if not present, data
is laid out by length in depth-first order.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A variable may contain zero or one map
descriptions. If present, the map represents a mapping between
possible values (the &quot;Key&quot; part of the map's pairs) and
convenient names for them (the &quot;Value&quot; part of the map's
pairs). 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Note that the current value of a
variable is not considered configuration definition information (see
item 1A and 1B in the introduction).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Configuration information must not be
packed into variables; each variable must represent one type of
information. In particular, the use of individual bits within larger
values to pack multiple pieces of information is forbidden; those
must be represented as individual variables. (How the information is
stored internally is up to the designer of the specific device, and
is not restricted; this requirement is about access to the
information, not about how it's laid out in physical memory)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">IV-b) A &quot;producer&quot;
description contains:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Name: String, required to be unique
within enclosing group or node</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Description: Optional String</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Replication count: Integer &gt;= 1
(number of times this producer definition is replicated within the
parent item)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Offset: Optional integer offset with in
the configuration address space for this item; if not present, data
is laid out by length in depth-first order.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A producer description may contain zero
or more variable descriptions for any variables that configure
details of the producer's function. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">IV-c) A &quot;consumer&quot;
description contains:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Name: String, required to be unique
within enclosing group or node</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Description: Optional String</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Replication count: Integer &gt;= 1
(number of times this consumer definition is replicated within the
parent item)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Offset: Optional integer offset with in
the configuration address space for this item; if not present, data
is laid out by length in depth-first order.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A consumer description may contain zero
or more variable descriptions for any variables that configure
details of the consumer function. This may include e.g. variables
that define how any content in incoming messages will be used.</P>
<H3>Serialization</H3>
<P>The logical layout in the previous section has to be converted to
some serial set of bytes for transfer and storage.</P>
<P>The primary format is straight-forward XML. (Link to schema)</P>
<P>Another is compressed binary information. Either an aggressive
compression algorithm, or some context-aware compression, can be
used. Size and ease of expansion are the key criteria; ease of
compression is much less important. XSLT can do some of the
reformatting between compact and readable form</P>
<P>We need to pick <U>one</U> format for a lingua franca.</P>
<H2>Example</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The following is not meant to show <U>how</U>
configuration definition information would be stored, but <U>what
kinds</U> of information would be stored. It's a description of a
complex accessory decoder, the Digitrax DS54, modified for use in a
Producer-Consumer model.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Some thoughts based on putting this
example together:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">1) In a real DS54, there are subtle
differences between the Switch and Aux configuration choices on the
various channels. I blurred those here by documenting them
identically via replication. For a real device, they could either be
separately specified or (more likely) the differences wouldn't matter
in a P/C-based device.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">2) A DS54 can receive messages that put
its output into four states: One side on, the other side on, both
sides on, and neither side on. These four interacts with the &quot;Output
Type&quot; setting in weird and wonderful ways. This was represented
as four consumers. This seems a much more logical way to configure
the device, as it gives more flexibility to the rest of the layout
that's originating the requests.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">3) The DS54 inputs also generate
messages. They are specified as two producers (for the active and
inactive messages).
