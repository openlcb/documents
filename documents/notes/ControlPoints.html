<P>I've been digging pretty deep into the wonderful trainspotting
field of ATCS Monitoring. Automatic Train Control System (also known
as &quot;another train calling STOP&quot; :-) is a modern
bidirectional communication mechanism between a &quot;dispatcher&quot;
and the various field units.</P>
<P>Much of my writing about userNames and associated abstractions is
influenced by what I have learned - the prototype goes to great
length to build and keep an abstraction layer between the dispatcher
and the field.</P>
<P>ATCS is (as is pretty much anything and everything on the
prototype) built around the concept of control points. CP's control
all the &quot;vital logic&quot; for a local area (aka
interlocking...), respond to external commands and provide status
reports when things change. If it helps, think about a cTc panel -
pressing it's Code button sends a set of commands out to the field;
the panel itself responds by showing lights that correspond to the
status reports coming in from the field.</P>
<P>The dispatcher's view of a railroad is that it is a collection of
CPs; the only interactions he/she has with the field units are via
these command and status reports. (It is not yet clear to me how
adjacent control points talk to each other - are there shared track
circuits or do they simply listen for each other's Indication
packets?)</P>
<P>In particular, the dispatcher does not need to know whether the CP
is implemented with a SMINI, an SE8e or a bank of relays - it only
communicates precise bits of information (see below for details) like
switch position, track occupancy and signal control (but only at a
&quot;stop, not-stop&quot; level, not individual control of each
head/bulb...)</P>

<P>This information is communicated to (Controls) or from
(Indications) the control point in packet form over code lines,
radio, laser, satellite or whatever. They have a bunch of header info
that identifies the railroad, the control point, sequence number and
the like, followed by 1 to 8 bytes of data. The data is interpreted
as a set of individual bits; they correspond exactly to the tables
shown in the MOW's signal department diagram above:</P>
<P>[Caltrain..CP Michael..C/I..Seq# : Byte1 Byte2 Byte3 Byte4 Byte5
Byte6 Byte7 Byte8 ]</P>
<P>From the diagram,</P>
<P>Control Byte1 is made up of [1NWS 1RWS 3NWS 3RWS 5NWS 5RWS 2SGHS
2NGHS]</P>
<P>and</P>
<P>Indication Byte1 has [1NWK 1RWK 3NWK 3RWK 5NWK 5RWK 2SGK 2NGK]</P>
<P>The other 3 bytes (controls) or 5 (indications) for CPMichael are
similarly interpreted.</P>
<P>Caltrain's &quot;ATCS architecture&quot; seems to prefer that
Control bits be interpreted as &quot;1=change, 0=no change&quot;,
thus the separate bits for &quot;Set Turnout 1 Normal&quot; (1NWS)
and Reverse (1RWS); A given Caltrain Control packet would, by
definition, never have both bits set. I call this &quot;relative&quot;
control - the assumption is that the field plant is in a known state
and the dispatcher are simply making incremental changes to that
state.</P>
<P>Other Realroads consider the control bits to be absolute; that is,
&quot;1=set/diverging, 0=clear/normal&quot;, and would use only one
bit per turnout (or whatever). No matter what the previous state of
the plant, a Control packet would set everything within the addressed
Control Point to a known state.</P>
<P>Since every Realroad's signal department gets to define the bits
being sent to and from each of their Control Points, there is never
any ambiguity - even if different control points on the RR do things
differently. Of course, the Brotherhood would quickly lynch any
consultant who designed wildly different interpretations for each
Control Point on the property...</P>
<P>As a real example, to set up the interlocking so a northbound
train can move from Track 1 (1ST track circuit) into Tamien:3 (3NT
circuit), one would send the following command bits out to the field:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:2SHS (set Signals 2N and 2S to STOP)</P>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:4SHS (set Signals 4N and 4S to STOP)</P>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:6SHS (set Signals 6N and 6S to STOP)</P>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:1RWS (set switch 1 to reverse)</P>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:3RWS (set switch 3 to reverse)</P>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:2NGHS (set Signal 2N to &quot;not STOP&quot;)</P>
</UL>
<P>The indiKation bits coming back after successfully following those
commands would be:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:</P>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:2TEK (Signals 2N and 2S are at STOP)</P>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:4TEK (Signals 4N and 4S are at STOP)</P>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:6TEK (Signals 6N and 6S are at STOP)</P>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:1RWK (switch 1 is reverse)</P>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:3RWK (switch 3 is reverse)</P>
	<LI><P>CP Michael:2NGK (signal 2N is other than Stop)</P>
</UL>
<P>As a train traversed this route, Indication packets containing
1TK, 2ATK, 2TK, and 3TK would also be sent showing track circuit
occupancy...</P>
<P>It is important to note that only complete Indication or Control
packets are ever sent or acted upon - think of them as transactions.
Any time a packet is received, the receiver knows that they are
seeing a self-consistent standalone representation of what the CP is
or should be.</P>

<P>I would describe ATCS as a codeline replacement technology. Rather
than maintaining coper wire codelines in the ground, railroads are
using ATCS or a slightly older technology called ARES (which was
deployed widely on the Burlington Northern in the late 1980s/early
1990s) and maintaining radio gear.</P>
<P>Since ARES and ATCS are sent in the clear over open radio
channels, we can decode the data stream without tapping any wires,
but otherwise this is the same data that must travel on the codeline.</P>

<P>Since ATCS is a codeline replacement, ATCS equiped control points
get information from their neighbors in exactly the same way that
codeline equiped control points do, i.e. by looking at local track
occupancy information.</P>
<P>The rest of the CTC system behaves in exactly the same manner as
it would with a codeline in place.</P>

<P>To amplify that a little: ATCS is not a vital system. Neither was
the code line. The occupancy information and other state that drives
the signaling is vital, and therefore doesn't go through ATCS. Nor
code line. Depending on the age of the equipment, that information
will be transferred via dedicated lines (wires; that's why old
pictures of rights-of-way would show telephone poles with dozens of
wires on them), through coded track circuits, dedicated phone links,
etc.</P>

<P>APB signals do pass information from one to another, but they're
also significantly more complicated than that. They have to be to
provide protection against opposing trains (the page linked above has
a good description of that), and also to allow for following moves
(signals go red _behind_ a train, too; if a signal always drops when
the one ahead is red, you end up blocking out following moves).</P>
<P>Provision of a vital direction relay, commanded by the CTC system,
simplifies the track circuits and logic a lot (vital circuitry is
very expensive to build and maintain, so this is important). By
making sure that the vital signaling will never allow two opposing
trains into the single-track between the control points, the need for
the overlaps is reduced, blocks can be lengthened (without a
direction relay you had to have at least four blocks between control
points; having fewer blocks means less vital equipment), etc.</P>

<P>This whole discussion is pretty intense, but seems to be missing a
pretty big point - in a modular mashup, not every detail of a
module's electronic animation/indication/control is something that
necessarily should be exposed to observers outside that module. In
programming terms, a module (or, if you prefer, a control point or an
interlocking or ...) is a lot like an object oriented class - there
are public, protected and private details. From where I sit, it seems
y'all are only talking about the public sorts of things in these
proposals.</P>
<P>While I may have missed something (after all, there *is* a lot
here to absorb), this discussion of node and layout IDs, gateways,
NN, 48, 64K, events and payloads sounds a lot like an intro level
programming course where nobody has discovered the concept of
abstraction - and where the only tools were global variables and
goto's. The predictable result in that class was unmaintainable
write-once spaghetti code; what will we end up with here?</P>
<P>I suspect that a fremo style modular mashup where every detail
from every module was public (nodes, events, whatever) would be both
undesirable and unmanageable. There is no reason for most of a
module's internal derails to be exposed to modules on the other end
of the mashup. There is a reason for scope and privacy abstractions
in railroading as well in computer science - it makes maintaining
things simpler. Borrowing computer science terms again, the vital
logic is mostly private to a control point, with some protected track
circuit and signal data being shared between adjacent CPs; the code
line is a public interface exposed by a control point, with the
details of that interface inherited from a common (ahem, mostly
historical) superclass. Local variables and procedural scoping are
used specifically to avoid namespace and data clashes between
independent modules of both flavors. (and, yes, the programming
analogy can be taken too far, but I hope it gets my point across...)</P>
<P>Instead of continuing to circle around esoteric interpretations of
node IDs, address space partitioning and gateways to allow more
'global variables', it might be worthwhile to step back and ask on
how someone could use this stuff to build a module that supported the
idea of private, protected and shared controls and indications. I'm
not certain that a bus-centric or node-centric approach is the right
(or, alternatively only) way to approach this problem, but if your
only tool is a CAN-bus segment hammer or Node ID (or payload) hammer,
the world quickly starts looking mostly like nails...</P>
<P>Myself, I'm experimenting with moving up the conceptual food chain
a notch and using Loconet or CAN as a *code line* replacement and
using custom programmed nodes (aka Arduinos + CMRI) as control
points. In that world, the details of whether signal 2N in Control
Point Michael should show an Approach or Approach Medium or
Restricting aspect is something managed locally by the control point
node itself. Just as in a cTc system, the only control a remote
observer has is whether or not the signal should display Stop or not,
and the only indications it can monitor are the ones the control
point explicitly chooses to expose.</P>

<P>My concern is that, with a module built up out of &quot;Signals

equivalent of implementation details exposed as global variables.
With smarter (or, I should say, more special purpose) nodes using
more of an &quot;Integrated Signals&quot; style, you begin to
approach the idea of a control point, but (I think) the spec
mentioned still misses the mark.</P>
<P>One subtle behavioral constraint of control points (or
interlockings) is that the whole of the physical plant is controlled
atomically - there is one &quot;control&quot; event (a code line
message) that contains, as payload, the commanded state* of every
controllable object in that control point, and one &quot;indication&quot;
event that contains the new, self consistent state of that control
point. There is no way to independently control the signal display
and the turnout position – if you send a control message that fails
the vital logic/interlocking protection check, the message is
effectively rejected without action by the CP. This is a subtle
point, to be sure...</P>
<P>____</P>
<P>* Each bit in a control message controls something in the CP. Some
railroads interpret the bits as 1=on,0=off and assign one bit per
item. Others interpret them as 1=change,0=nochange and effectively
assign two bits per item. That is, either one bit is taken to mean a
switch is normal or reversed, or two bits are used, one to command it
normal and another to command it reverse. The difference is the
former always conveys the absolute position of everything, the other
conveys only the changes to be made.</P>

8-bits - that would leave 32 bits.</P>
<P>Events may not really be the most appropriate tool for this
purpose, though. Perhaps it better would be to use a Datagram, which
allows up to 72 bytes (576 bits) of data. Datagrams are buffered so
you would have the required atomic 'code line message'. See:

<P>The alternative is to send a set of messages followed by a final
'execute' message which applies all the previous messages if they are
valid, and reports the result. This is likely to be more flexible,
and efficient, as you could then just send changes. (but perhaps not
so prototypical)</P>

<P>The most I've seen is 8 bytes (64 bits) of control or indication
data, with most being much less than that (3 or 4 bytes). On

<P>I'll try and collect my CP musings and put them somewhere, though
I don't see them as &quot;only&quot; applicable to the openLCB
effort; IMO, all the various &quot;competing&quot; LCB efforts need
to consider making it possible to wire and control ones layout in as
prototypical a fashion as one operates and scenics</P>

<P>John Plocher has me thinking about &quot;control points&quot;
again. He's pointed out that the prototype railroads do a lot of
local control of track circuits, turnout position &amp; feedback, and
signals using just a thin connection to higher control at e.g. the
dispatching system. All the &quot;vital&quot; logic that keeps the
system safe is co-located at the &quot;control point&quot; in the
field. Upstream of that has very limited visibility into the control
point; for example, it's not possible to tell the appearance of a
particular signal from the dispatchers desk, just whether it's been
cleared or not. (Signals that are not clear are certainly at &quot;stop&quot;,
i.e. red, but the converse is not true). 
</P>
<P>I suspect that the prototype would _like_ to have lots of
information  available remotely, for no other reason than
debugging, but during the periods that many people model it didn't.
So they developed this two,  and in some cases, three or four,
level system.</P>
<P>There aren't a lot of bits in the communication between the
control point and higher authority (USS systems had a strict
limitation of 13  bits, with most stations much less than that; 5
or so in each direction was quite typical). The prototype connection
was between a single set of dispatcher logic and each control point
via a single &quot;code line&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Some people will want to implement their layout controls like
this (e.g. it might be a good approach for modular layouts), so
OpenLCB should support it gracefully and effectively. So I've been
thinking about it during the &quot;tray tables up&quot; part of my
trips this week.</P>
<P>One approach might be &quot;control point nodes&quot; that sit
between the main OpenLCB LCB on one side and
signals/turnouts/sensors behind it on the other side. Like the
relay hut at a prototype control point, this node does all the local
logic using connections to the hardware, and communicates via
summary messages to higher authority. This works pretty well so long
as somebody builds monolithic boards that handle the logic, plus the
needed electronics: occupancy detectors, turnout driver(s), signal
drivers, perhaps connections for facia buttons, etc.</P>
<P>Imagine a much smarter version of the Digitrax SE8c. The SE8c
board's prime purpose is as a signal driver; it can connect to and
drive 32 heads. But it also connects to sensors (pushbuttons, track
circuits) and drives turnouts through Tortoises. Those are all
directly connected, not via any kind of bus, and full-size SE8c
implementations tend to become a real rats nest, but let's set that
aside for a moment. The SE8c gives full access to what's &quot;behind&quot;
it. As I understand it, Digitrax's original idea was to have the SE8c
_also_ provide local signal logic, performing &quot;vital logic&quot;
to control the signals locally. (They never released this, but they
did show it working at one of the NMRA National Train Shows). So
creating &quot;control points&quot; is taking hardware with that
same kind of diversity, either directly or via a sub-bus, and giving
it some local configurable intelligence. 
</P>
<P>If one wants to be able to pick and choose among the
electronics _behind_ the control point board, e.g. so you can
install your turnout driver or sensors of choice, then you're
talking about some form of interface, perhaps even a little OpenLCB
implementation that the control point board uses to talk to them.
It doesn't have to be CAN, because it's over a small distance, small
number of nodes, with complete control in the hands of the
controller board. But it would be useful for there to be (one or
more) common definitions, so people can pick and choose their
components. SPI? One wire? MERG shift register? I don't know enough
about those to know how well they're work over e.g. 2 or 3 meters,
with roughly 10 or 15 addressable devices that need to be very
cheap. 
</P>
<P>For debugging, etc, it would be nice if every one of those
devices remained addressable and controllable from the main
OpenLCB. When a device fails on the prototype, the signal
maintainer goes out to the hut to operate it individually and figure
out what's wrong. I've spent many an hour flipping an output back
and forth from my phone while trying to figure out why a particular
signal isn't working right on a local layout, and I'd like for that
to continue even when that signal is behind a control point. That
doesn't mean that each device behind the control point node needs
to be a full OpenLCB implementation, with the board being just a
gateway; that's probably not a great approach. But it does lead in
the direction of a board that can act as a local control for a
bunch of simple (brainless?) devices, making them full partners on
the LCB, and also providing local control for them as the control
point implementation of the vital logic. 
</P>
<P>Can the OpenLCB protocols do this? The code line communication
is between specific things (control point logic and dispatcher
logic) so point-to-point datagrams could easily replicate that.
There's good reason to want that communication more visible, however,
for example to drive multiple displays of layout status, so perhaps
using event ranges might be a better approach given the small number
of bits.  
</P>
<P>One open question is the station-to-station communications.
In addition to the code line communication between control point
and dispatching logic, the control points exchange state with their
neighbors. They need to know about signal state, occupancy,
etc, particularly on model railroads which tend to have few (if
any) intermediate blocks. That communication is by specific wires &amp;
relays on the prototype, but in a model it should go by the LCB
somehow. That could be listening to events for specifics state
changes, but I think this needs a little bit more thought on the
details. There are a couple of approaches. 
</P>
<P>If this can be worked out, it would map up rather nicely to the
issue of signaling for modular layouts. It's rare for a modular
layout to split the parts of a control point across more than one
module (or set of modules). So a control point board could control
that and communicate to a central dispatcher _if_ neighbor
communications can be sorted out.   
</P>
<P>I think we need more experimentation in this area.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(1) Agree that OpenLCB should support,
and I see no reason it can't. I had imagined that we service the
'code line' via datagram or event-range, but also recommend a more
(OpenLCB) traditional interface to the node for config and debugging,
and there is not reason why the two views can't exist together –
one is operational, the other not.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(2) RRCircuits is developing just such
a Control Point, which interfaces to BODs and Signals, and does the
CP logic, and communicates on the bus.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(3) The station-to-station controls
fits nicely with our auto-topology ideas. It would be nice if we
could mimic the individual control lines easily and directly using
events or datagrams.</P>
