<H1>OpenLCB Note: LocoNet Connections</H1>
<P>OpenLCB should be able to both control devices via LocoNet and
have LocoNet-attached devices create OpenLCB events. Layout events
such as turnout throws, sensor changes, etc, should be mapped to and
from OpenLCB P/C Event messages so they can be used without
limitation.</P>
<P>A LocoNet is a limited resource, so large modular meets already
use multiple interconnected LocoNets. The OpenLCB support should
allow these to interoperate with OpenLCB devices, if not with each
other, transparently.</P>
<P>Some messages could be carried via the low-order e.g. 4 or 6 bytes
of events (routing would require “route range” support, not yet
present), but some are long enough to require datagrams.</P>
<H2>LocoNet Protocol Summary</H2>
<P>LocoNet uses variable-length messages, with the length encoded in
the first byte as part of an op-code. The MSB is used to indicate
message boundaries. The last byte of each message is a check byte.</P>
<P>The messages for controlling turnouts (accessory decoders) and
sensors are four bytes long. LocoNet defines two separate address
spaces for turnouts, and at least two for sensors. Throttle (DCC)
control is done via a mix of four-byte and much longer messages.</P>
<P>LocoNet has provision for a seven-bit “LocoNet ID” to separate
multiple radio-operated LocoNets located close together. The vast
majority of LocoNets use the default value, but modular layout groups
require the ability to set unique LocoNet IDs. The LocoNet ID should
be carried so that LocoNets don't collide at big meets.</P>
<H2>Mapping LocoNet onto OpenLCB</H2>
<P>This section describes connecting an existing LocoNet segment to
an OpenLCB instance so that the LocoNet-attached hardware can be used
from OpenLCB.</P>
<P>LocoNet layout control messages effectively already are P/C
events, in that they are broadcast to a set of unknown listeners.
Mapping a set of these to and from unique EventIDs would make the
connection to OpenLCB straightforward. Working at the level of
“layout control messages” instead of separate “turnout
messages” and “sensor messages” is a more general approach.</P>

</P>
<P>The unique ID is taken from (somebody's) assigned name space, so
that it's guaranteed to remain unique. The Digitrax
manufacturer-assigned space starts in byte 3, for example, so there
is plenty of space for this assignment. If there are ever multiple
protocols for LocoNet gateways, they'd be distinguished by separate
Unique IDs.</P>
<P>Two ways of mapping LocoNet to and from OpenLCB have been
proposed. In the “transformation” approach, the gateway parses
incoming LocoNet messages to extract their type, device address, etc,
and then this is used to form the message-specific content of the
event.</P>
<P>Another approach, which simplifies the gateway code, is just send
LocoNet messages as received. Short ones fit in a single OpenLCB
event message. (To send a LocoNet packet on a LocoNet, the remote
gateway has to look at the 1<SUP>st</SUP> byte to decide how many
bytes are present to send; the check byte isn't sent over OpenLCB)</P>
<P>For example, the LocoNet packet to throw turnout 12 is 0xB0 0x0B
0x10 0x54</P>
<P>The corresponding OpenLCB Event ID would be:</P>

</P>
<P>Any OpenLCB device wanting throw LocoNet turnout 12 or be notified
when LocoNet turnout 12 has been thrown could just use this Event ID.</P>
<P>LocoNet messages longer than four bytes would be sent as multiple
event messages. Since OpenLCB is a reliable ordered transport, the
LocoNet MSB and length code in byte 4 of the first message is
sufficient for reassembling a LocoNet message before transmitting it
on the LocoNet link.</P>
<P>This approach has the advantage that it is completely transparent
to changes and additions to the LocoNet protocol itself.</P>
<H3>Transponding and Lissy Messages</H3>
<P>LocoNet also carries longer messages that report transponding and
Lissy conditions. 
</P>
<P>A transponding message is 14 bits of locomotive address, 1 bit of
arrived/departed, and 12 bits of transponder section address, for a
total of 27 bits. Not all combinations are used, because the NMRA
locomotive address doesn't fill the 14 bits of address, but it can't
be fit in three bytes.</P>
<P>A Lissy message is 14 bits of locomotive address, 1 bit of
direction, and 7 bits of section address for a total of 22 bits.</P>
<P>Like the coding for 3-byte LocoNet messages provided previously,
these messages can be encoded in the low bytes of an EventID. With
LocoNetID, 34 bits are required.</P>
<H3>Technical Issues</H3>
<P>It may be useful to align the LocoNet ID in a common location,
perhaps not bit-aligned, in the formats for all three message types.</P>
<P>Flow control and buffering in a bridge needs to be addressed. 
LocoNet is much slower than even the CAN implementation of OpenLCB,
so only minimal buffering is needed for LocoNet to OpenLCB
tranformations.  That same speed mismatch makes the other direction,
OpenLCB to LocoNet, more problematic.  Since only events targeted to
the LocoNet need to be transferred, a large buffer is probably
sufficient. 
</P>
<P>Synchronization:  The LocoNet protocol doesn't usually send
synchronizing response messages.  Programs talking to LocoNet usually
decode the echoed stream to see where in the command sequence their
output messages appear, which they use to model that consistent state
of the LocoNet attached devices.  OpenLCB events are not synchronized
in this same way, and are not normally echoed. It would be easy for a
gateway to re-emit back into the OpenLCB all the events that it
places on the LocoNet, but it's still to be decided whether it
should.  Maybe with an “echo” bit set in the format, to the
meaning is not ambiguous?</P>
<H2>Using OpenLCB over LocoNet</H2>
<P>This section describes how OpenLCB nodes can send messages over
LocoNet links.</P>
<P>The approach under investigation is using the CAN frame protocol,
encapsulating the 4-12 byte can frame into a LocoNet packet. 
</P>
<P>We still need to make sure that the node assignment algorithm will
work on LocoNet instead of CAN. Once that works, the only real
problem is bandwidth consumption. An OpenLCB event message is 4+8
bytes, plus at least 6 bytes of LocoNet overhead (including the bytes
of 8<SUP>th</SUP> bits), for roughly 18 bytes, as compared to 4 bytes
in native LocoNet.</P>
