<H1>OpenLCB Note: Display Protocol</H1>
<P>OpenLCB achieves flexibility and economy of implementation by
using many small, general, common protocols to provide larger control
functions. This note describes a common protocol for driving small
information displays around a layout. These might include small
screens in <A HREF="LocomotiveControl.html">throttles</A>, fixed
displays at stations, and similar.</P>
<H2>Environment of Proposal</H2>
<H3>Requirements</H3>
<P>Provide character-oriented multi-line displays.</P>
<H3>Preferences</H3>
<P>Must support multiple displays on a single node.</P>
<P>Multiple formats (fonts, sizes, colors) desirable.</P>
<P>Graphical display as a future extension.</P>
<P>Nodes with displays should be able to advertise them globally.</P>
<P>Display users should be able to enquire about display
capabilities.</P>
<P>Stream access for large display transfers should be available, but
not required.</P>
<H3>Design Points</H3>
<P>Single directional, point-to-point datagram protocol, where the
sender knows the node ID of the receiver, works well in OpenLCB.</P>
<P>Node provides single-point-of-contact for all attached displays,
similar to X11 display vs display manager addressing.</P>
<P>Uses global event to advertise that this node has one or more
displays.</P>
<P>Minimal capability should be assumed, but if more is needed, the
sender has more resources than the receiver.</P>
<P>HTML provides a useful lingua franca for formatted text, but adds
length to messages. Can be too large for single datagram, so must
provide stream option for formated text.</P>
<P>Reservation capability needed? Optional?</P>
<P>Other than reservation, want protocol to be stateless and
idempotent, so that multiple users can share a display by e.g.
writing to different lines.</P>
<P>Operations besides load text: Clear? Address to a specific
character? Single frames too small for even a single line, but
datagrams are a good size.</P>
<P>Writing character data is conceptually different from writing
HTML. Characters has e.g. locations, while HTML is just “content”.
Not clear how you e.g. specify a starting location for HTML text.</P>
<P>Eventually, want support for definable characters (LED style), bit
map displays, etc. HTML forms a good example of this.</P>
<H2>Proposed Protocol</H2>
<H3>Datagram Format</H3>
<P>Basic format is datagram-ID-byte, display-protocol-command-byte,
then variable arguments. Arguments are usually one byte display, two
bytes character address, leaving 64+ bytes in the datagram for writes
&amp; reads.</P>

<H3>Display Addresses</H3>
<P>Each node can have one or more displays. Each display is separate,
and may have different characteristics. The details of this are found
using the “Enquire/Capability” part of the protocol, which can be
done with canned messages.</P>
<P>Once that's done, addressing is via a single 8-bit number in each
message. The numbers are assigned by the display node, and don't have
to be consecutive, but it's easier for users of the protocol if they
are. The convention is that the first display is 0.</P>
<H3>Character Addresses</H3>
<P>256x256 is perhaps too small for an addressable character screen,
but it's not a clearly too small in total characters, just in each
dimension. Anything bigger than that might be e.g. 2048x1. Use 12
bits for each? Use 2 bytes total, with movable rows vs column divide?
That's just too complicated. 
</P>
<P>Do we need a way to say “whatever is next”? E.g. not require
the sender control character location if not desired?</P>
<H3>Capability Flags</H3>
<P>Streams Available – node can accept stream writes</P>
<P>Read Available – node can return content of display</P>
<P>Read Stream Available – node can return content of display via
stream</P>
<P>HTML Available – (basic) HTML will be accepted, but not
necessary all features will be displayed</P>
<P>Clear Available; Clear Line Available</P>
<P>Character Direct Addressing Available; Line Direct Addressing
Available</P>
<P>Reserve Available</P>
<H3>Reserve Protocol</H3>
<P>Reserve/release is a simple flagging protocol, it doesn't require
the display node to modify it's behavior.</P>
<P>If the node is not reserved, a request to reserve it will put the
requesting node and key in the “reserved by field”. If it is
reserved, the field won't be changed. In either case, the reserve
field is returned.</P>
<P>If the requester finds the requested node and key in the reply,
the reserve request succeeded. If not, it didn't.</P>
<H2>Examples</H2>
<P>It would be useful to show how this works for a throttle, or for a
fast clock repeater, or for giving train orders at a remote station.</P>
<H3>Simple Write</H3>
<P>A node locates the display, perhaps via a global event, and wants
to make it display “Hello World”. Datagram segmentation and
replies omitted.</P>
