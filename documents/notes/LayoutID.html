<H1 CLASS="western">Should NMRAnet Define a “Layout ID”?</H1>
<P>This note contains discussion on whether NMRAnet needs to define a
“Layout ID” for use in e.g. wireless communications.</P>
<P>Wireless communications raises several issues for NMRAnet...</P>
<P>CAN, Ethernet: Everything you can reach, you can reach. Wireless
is a little more complicated, as you can <U>choose</U> which
connection to make, resulting in being able to communicate with
different things. E.g. a wireless throttle at a convention has to be
connected to a specific NMRAnet communications infrastructure.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Two NMRAnet layouts can coexist on a single CAN segment, Ethernet,
as unique node IDs &amp; event IDs separate all meaning. Separately
configured nodes will just communicate past each other.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“Layout” is not a defined concept in NMRAnet. Nodes
communicate, and different nodes might have very different
(overlapping or non-overlapping) domains of communication. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>NMRAnet is silent on connection methods, wireless or otherwise: It
uses other, hopefully industry standard, protocols. E.g. you pick a
particular access point by name when connecting your computer, and
then you're connected to something specific.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If you have several physical layouts on the same Ethernet
and you have  to reconfigure one of them, how do you tell just that
subset of nodes  to reset but have the rest carry on normally? To me
this feels like a  broadcast address for each layout.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But is there a global reset? Why?</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To me this kinda feels like selecting power districts at
least. What  if we are able to have a group of DCC Command Stations
that auto  distribute DCC addresses somehow (like FREMO does) then
how do you  discover that and interact with it?
 … I think we will
want some notion of what  nodes a layout is comprised of and provide
a way to interact with in  different ways.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="margin-left: 0cm">This seems to have identified a
reason for a “named group of nodes” construct, which can be used
for several things besides “Layout ID”.  It's not so much a way
to identify which layout to connect to, but rather a way to deal with
multiple nodes via shorthand.  But what is there to say?  It's hard
to design a mechanism unless there's <U>some</U> idea of that to use
it for.  Events already go to all nodes who are listening to them;
streams can be sent to multiple nodes who are interested (so far). 
Is this only needed to <U>force</U> a group of nodes to pay
attention?</BLOCKQUOTE>
