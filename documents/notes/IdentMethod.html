<H1>Ident Method(s)</H1>
<P>Users may want to be able to identify a specific board (node) to a
configuration tool. We refer to this as an “ident” operation,
similar to the way that a pilot presses the “ident” button on a
plane's transponder to light up the proper echo on a traffic
controller's screen.</P>
<P>This note is a working draft proposal.</P>
<H2>Use Cases</H2>
<P>A user wants to use a configuration tool to configure a new input
on node A, located under the far end of the layout. He presses button
on the node, and the tool learns which node (specifically, the Node
ID). The tool then lights an indicator on the board to confirm that
it's found the right one.</P>
<P>A user walks from module to module on a modular layout, pressing
buttons. A configuration tool sees the sequence of button presses and
checks it against the expected module-to-module connections.</P>
<H2>Protocol</H2>
<P>We standardize on emitting the global event 0x 01 00 00 00 FE 00
to indicate an “ident”.</P>
<P>For nodes with blue and gold buttons, we recommend that pushing
both of them (briefly!) at the same time send an ident. On release,
the node should not be left in specific blue/gold programming state.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We recommend that configuration tools
reply to an ident global event with a <A HREF="ConfigurationProtocol.html">configuration
protocol</A> “confirm” command. This will tell the user that the
tool has seen the user identification of the node.</P>
<H2>Discussion</H2>
<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>There are (at least) four ways of doing this, each with advantages
and disadvantages. In this section, we discuss those briefly to
explain why we picked the protocol described above.</P>
<H4>Dedicated Node-Specific Event</H4>
<P>One way to provide an “ident” capability would be to define a
node-specific EventID that nodes produce to identify themselves. For
example, reserving 0xFF,FF in the lower bytes, with the NodeID in the
upper bytes, would give a unique indication that an ident button was
pressed.</P>
<H5>Advantages</H5>
<P>The identification messages need to propagate across the entire
LCB. P/C Events are the OpenLCB general mechanism for doing this. 
</P>
<H5>Disadvantages</H5>
<P>Makes the event address space a lot less orthogonal.</P>
<P>Don't want every node to emit “produces” and “consumes”
messages for general event IDs, so would have to build that into
routing as a special case (this is an issue just beyond this use of
generic EventID signaling). That's a lot of special case entries.</P>
<H4>Dedicated Global Event</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We could define a global eventID that
indicates “ident”; the source ID in the message then provides the
information needed to track down the source.</P>
<H5>Advantages</H5>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Small footprint, stays orthogonal.</P>
<H5>Disadvantages</H5>
<P>Requires the global eventID space be implemented, specifically in
routers and gateways. That's a single range, though, so it's only one
entry in any routing tables.</P>
<P>Requires central allocation of the specific EventID, but this only
needs to be done once.</P>
<H4>Configuration Message</H4>
<P>A specific form of configuration message within the <A HREF="ConfigurationProtocol.html">configuration
protocol</A> can be reserved for this.</P>
<P>The configuration protocol already has a “confirm” mechanism
to signal the proper board by e.g. lighting a light. Being able to
send a message back via button push, so that the configuration tool
can get positive confirmation of the right board, would be useful.</P>
<H5>Advantages</H5>
<P>The configuration protocol already has a “confirm” mechanism
to signal the proper board by e.g. lighting a light. Being able to
send a message back via button push, so that the configuration tool
can get positive confirmation of the right board, would be useful.</P>
<P>This is the only one of the four that might be able to handle
multiple idents at the some time, e.g. during modular layout setup,
by using the original configuration message to specify a particular
return message. But it's not at all clear how to do overlapping
idents in the same node.</P>
<H5>Disadvantages</H5>
<P>Since the configuration protocol is point-to-point, the node with
the button press needs to find out where to send the message. It's
not at all clear how to solve this. It's not practical to first
communicate with all nodes so they know you want to hear when their
button is pressed.</P>
<H4>Dedicated Message Type</H4>
<P>A specific OpenLCB message type could be defined for this, with a
specific MTI. This could then be specified to propagate as needed.</P>
<H5>Advantages</H5>
<P>Can specify it exactly, without compromise.</P>
<H5>Disadvantages</H5>
<P>MTIs are eventually a scarce resource.</P>
<P>Another special case in code. This is not an incredibly large
issue, as simple nodes need only emit a fixed message, and routing
nodes just pass it through.</P>
<H3>Use of Buttons</H3>
<P>The Blue/Gold configuration method is already using a single press
of each button for normal operation. Multiple presses of the blue
button are used to index to a particular producer or consumer. A
double press of the gold button (gold, no blue, then gold again)
teaches a new unique event. A long press of both buttons does a
“factory reset”. A long press of the blue button removes any
learn reservations.</P>
<P>That leaves either a short press of both buttons at the same time,
or a long press of the gold button. Long presses aren't as good for
something as routine as “ident”, so the short double-press is
preferred.
