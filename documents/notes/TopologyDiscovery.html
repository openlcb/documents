<H1>Note: Discovering Topology</H1>
<P>On how OpenLCB can help a large modular layout discover (or
confirm) how the modules are connected.</P>
<H2>June 2010 David Harris Proposal</H2>
<P>Modular clubs, and larger modular-meets need a way of configuring
modules into a cohesive whole that is time and effort efficient. This
proposal suggests some approaches to this. Essentially, an
organization would set some standards and define some standard Events
to implement that standard. 
</P>
<P>(See also the separate figure in a <A HREF="images/images/ATC2.pdf">PDF
file</A>) 
</P>
<P>Each modular organization, eg NTrak, defines a protocol and a set
of *fixed* events representing edge-messages for intra-module
communication. They would also assign a range of &quot;Module IDs&quot;
to clubs and individuals. So, I might be assigned: (symbolically)
NTrak.dpharris.xx, based on my membership number (01.00.34.02.54.xx,
say), where xx is my modules' numbers. 
</P>
<P>In this proposal the module ID represents a virtual-node, and it
can represent a single NTrak module, or a set of NTrak modules, which
comprise one or more nodes. 
</P>
<P>In addition, the organization defines fixed events, eg: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">0001 Start auto-topography
	configuration 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">0002 Stop ATC 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">0003 Track 1 East block is
	occupied 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">0004 Track 1 East block is
	unoccupied 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">0005 Track 1 East signal is stop 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">0006 Track 1 East signal is
	caution 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">0007 Track 1 East signal is
	proceed 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">... 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">001D Track 3 West block is
	occupied 
	</P>
	<LI><P>.... 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>Each NTrak module(s) would be required to implement these fixed
events. This can be done with a dedicated node, possibly obtained
from the organizing committee, or implemented across a number of
nodes, one at each end of teh module(s), say. To ease set-up, a
special configuration tool might be provided that knows the event
numbers, and can program the appropriate event slots in the nodes. 
</P>
<H3>How it works: 
</H3>
<P>Consider two modules A and B. 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">east signal ---&gt; ======loco&gt;== ============== &gt; &gt; &lt;--- west-signal</PRE><P>
Option 1 - creating the layout by taking a loco for a spin: 
</P>
<P>When a loco is transitions from module-A to module-B from west to
east, module- B will report east-block-occupied and east-signal-state
events. In the case of my module, it would send:
NTrak.dpharris.01.0003 and NTrak.dpharris.01.0005. Since, module-A
knows the loco is present on it, and that it is exiting to the east,
it will be expecting to receive some events from its adjacent block.
It will insert these into into the appropriate event-slots:
West-block-occupied and West-signal-stop. In addition, it will learn
the module-id of the adjacent module, as it is embedded in the
module-event#s. Similarly, when the loco leaves module-A, module-B
will learn about module-A. In addition, if a module remembers the
last protocol events it sees, then as soon as it becomes occupied, it
can insert these events into the appropriate event-slots. 
</P>
<P>Option 2 - creating the layout centrally: 
</P>
<P>Each track has a one wire electrical bidirectional connection
between modules. A central meet-network manager gathers all the
module IDs, and then tells each one in succession to report while it
simultaneously activates each inter-module line. It repeats this with
each module in succession. In more detail, the manager tells node-A
to report. Node-A activates its Track 1 East intra-module line and
sends the associated East messages. The next node reports
'West-intra-module-line-activated' and fills its slots with node-A's
events. This process quickly establishes the topology of the layout.
The intra-module messages can either be learned by the modules at
this time, as the above, or the network manager can set them
explicitly at a later time. 
</P>
<H3>Discussion: 
</H3>
<H4>Advantages: 
</H4>
<P>This should speed up connecting modules. Additional central
functions of a 'meet-network manager' could be to draw a scale plan
of the layout, if dimensions of each module is available in an
electronic form , either from the module-nodes or on separate media. 
</P>
<H4>Disadvantages: 
</H4>
<P>This requires some coordination, although not that much. Different
organizations, even down to the individual level can have differing
standards and protocols. This can be a good or bad thing. 
</P>
<H3>Comments: 
</H3>
<P>Can tumble-down be automatically configured, if the appropriate
nodes are told to do tumble-down? Similarly, a module that goes from
a single to double track via a turnout could manage its assignments
based on the setting of its turnout. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Note the nodes in these modules still
have their own node IDs and events. 
</P>
<H2>May 2010 Discussion</H2>
<P>Using CAN would work better if only one end was connected at a
time.  How about a switch in the middle of every module, which can
disconnect the ends from each other? Open the switch, have the end of
module A communicate to the end of module B ot figure out what's
going on, then close the switch and have everybody communicate their
results.</P>
<P>Alternately, have that be a module in the center that can control
the switch too, and do it remotely.  Each module closes its switch,
and then tells the newly combined network to close the next switches,
and pretty soon it's all connected up again (does that work when
opening the switches?  Must ensure that everybody hears before
opening up)</P>
<H2>October 2009 Discussion</H2>
<H3>David Harris</H3>
<P>MERG list has been batting ideas around about how to do signalling
and other control using local links between control points.</P>
<P>I think we need to try to define this for OpenLCB, and we have
previously made some suggestions around this. I think including local
topological links are a good idea. Alan and others had suggested
using a 1-wire like interface to send node.interface info between
adjacent nodes -- while in addition having a LCB connection for
information flow, both between nodes and to others, such as displays.
The suggestion is to have 4-6 links per node, to connect to adjacent
nodes. In the case of a track section, only two are needed, for a
turnout, three, and for slips and other nodes, perhaps up to 6. 
</P>
<P>One idea would be to use a very simple active-low 1-wire link. A
node would pull-down the appropritate link concurrently with&nbsp;a
successful transmission of (specific) LCB packets. The links would
notify adjacent nodes to process the associated LCB-packets. The
packets would include the NID and interface#, for auto-configuration,
but also other information with state -- for example occupancy,
signal state, etc. 
</P>
<H3>Alan Robinson</H3>
<P>It's interesting you've picked this one up. The discussion was
sparked off by Pertti Tapola, a new Finnish member of the MERG Yahoo
Group. His postings are - how shall I say it - voluminous (pot
calling kettle black?) but so far he's been a great brain-stormer who
likes to discuss options rather than fight for&nbsp;some stupid
corner. It'might be good to have him on board, but I've no idea if
he'd be at all interested. 
</P>
<P>We haven't got as simple as a 1-wire interface yet. Mike
Bolton&nbsp;asked if we were familiar with Dallas One-Wire, but
that's all. The most likely options discussed so far have been my own
QCBSP (3 pins/wires minimum per neighbour link) and software UARTs (2
pins/wires minimum). So far, I'm inclined to favour UARTs (software,
probably, but the standard needn't specify) for this job. If you've
got a suggestion using only one wire, I'm all ears. If not, can we
come up with one? 
</P>
<P>I'm a bit nervous about using a simple open-collector link and a
protocol operating over the bus because it has to work without any
central control. If two nodes simultaneously try to establish who
their neighbours are, how do we guarantee they don't interfere?
It&nbsp;might not&nbsp;be too hard if they're on the same CAN
segment, but if not, what then?&nbsp;That could happen in a
get-together&nbsp;where&nbsp;adjacent modules&nbsp;are on
different&nbsp;CAN segments. 
</P>
<P>Half-duplex software UARTs, perhaps? If the neighbour links only
have to carry repeated node ID and port number, message
collisions&nbsp;ought to be&nbsp;easy to deal with. If each node
tries again after a pseudo-random interval based on its node ID
(we've already&nbsp;mandated code that does most of that), and
doesn't start to transmit if it has seen an incoming start bit, that
should work. Another refinement: once a node has successfully
received its neighbour's node ID, it could drop to a much lower but
still pseudo-random transmission rate. Hmmmm. Didn't think of that
until now: I think I'll post&nbsp;it on MERG. 
</P>
<P>Whether the neighbour links also carry track occupancy, etc. as
well is a moot point. The MERG discussions so far haven't ruled a
common bus in or out. Pertti's starting point was NX routing using
distributed modules. The comms topology is still entirely up for
grabs. What we're talking about here is his option (2) out of quite a
lot, which uses a bus and neighbour links to establish who is next
door to who. My initial inclination (that's all it is) is to say that
the neighbour links are only used to establish topology. If they only
carry node ID and port number, they can be slow as hell and therefore
easily interference-proof and dirt cheap, as well as using up very
little processing power. Once a node knows who its neighbours are, it
can do all the rest via the bus.</P>
<P>Are you happy with my terminology, 'Neighbour Link', and 'Port
Number' especially? We'd have to agree something. 
</P>
<H3>Bob Jacobsen</H3>
<P>I think, in the context of OpenLCB, all you need is the ability to
advertise a few bytes to your physical neighbors. 
</P>
<P>The distance involved isn't large, because you're connecting
&quot;right next door&quot;. If you're willing to pull a two-wire
cable &amp; use a common CAN ground, you could use e.g. the Maxim
1-wire 64-bit part which is practically free. Except for the shared
ground, no other electrical connection is needed; the part is powered
by the 1-wire connection. 
</P>
<P>Example protocol: 
</P>
<P>Goal is to find the node ID of the node handling various things on
the adjacent module. From there, you can build up whatever protocol
needed for EventIDs, etc. 
</P>
<P>Some nodes have a &quot;next-door identification feature&quot;
(NDIF); all others aren't involved. 
</P>
<P>A) Send out a specific broadcast NMRA communication that means
&quot;All NDIF nodes, do your thing&quot;. I'd use a specific
reserved EventID for this, but you could use a special op code. 
</P>
<P>B) All NDIF nodes hear the message and read 48 bits from their
neighbor. Those 48 bits are the neighbors nodeID. Now they've got
that NodeID, and are happy for their internal purposes. 
</P>
<P>C) In addition, the NDIF nodes can datagram that information to
whoever sent (A), since the source of (A) was known from that
message. (A) then picks up the entire topology from the combination
of source&amp;next-door-ID in those messages. And there's enough
redundancy to detect lots of types of errors. 
</P>
<P>So what can you do with a neighbor's node ID? That Node ID is key
to identifying known-unique events that your neighbor could emit. For
example, establish a convention that modules will have a node at each
end, emitting ID/1 for last block occupied; ID/2 for last block not
occupied; ID/3 for block track not clear to enter (turnout set
against , or whatever), etc. Now you've got a signaling and control
system that can automatically set up. 
</P>
<P>The protocol is standard OpenLCB, with special boards (for the
next-door connection) and conventions on use. 
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The distance involved isn't large, because you're

powered by the 1-wire connection.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Not so sure about that. The longest likely neighbour link would be
the length of the longest plain-track block, plus some more for where
modules are located and round-the-houses wiring routes. Long wires
are likely to be loomed or trunked with others, and we don't know
what those wires are carrying, so it could be noisy. I think the
neighbour links should be about as noise immune as the CAN bus is.
There's little point in making them much better, unless that's
achievable at no extra cost. Some sort of low bit-rate comms would
make this objective easier to meet because interference will be
mostly HF, which can be filtered out by a simple RC. Achieving noise
immunity does of course include packet validation in software. One
simple way would be to accept the data only when the same values have
been received more than once. A bit more thinking needed, perhaps. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>B) All NDIF nodes hear the message and read 48 bits from
their neighbor. Those 48 bits are the neighbors nodeID. Now they've
got that NodeID, and are happy for their internal purposes. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes, except port number is needed too, for the (probably few)
cases where adjacent nodes have more than one neighbour link. One
case I thought of was a reversing loop where a plain track module has
both its links connected to the same turnout module. That said,
Pertti has cast doubt on whether plain track modules are needed. But
he started with ideas on how to do NX routing without a central
signalbox, and he's now moving on to automatic control of the trains
as well (expect DC versus DCC sparks!), so I don't know where that's
heading. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So what can you do with a neighbor's node ID? That Node
ID is key to identifying known-unique events that your neighbor could
emit. For example, establish a convention that modules will have a
node at each end, emitting ID/1 for last block occupied; ID/2 for
last block not occupied; ID/3 for block track not clear to enter
(turnout set against , or whatever), etc. Now you've got a signaling
and control system that can automatically set up. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes. Plus number of blocks ahead unoccupied, lengths of those
blocks, and speed limits: info which could be input to a superbly
realistic automatic train control process. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The protocol is standard OpenLCB, with special boards
(for the next-door connection) and conventions on use. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes. And neighbour-to-neighbour comms would use directed packets,
not events. Since the data passed could get quite complex, should it
use the streaming protocol, one stream per neighbour link? 
</P>
<P>Why is the broadcast message in (A) above needed, and who sends
it? If the neighbour links are only ever used to send node ID and
port number, they could simply transmit them continuously. That would
fit in nicely with data validation by comparing successive frames. 
</P>
<P>So how about this: the neighbour link protocol includes a bit that
says 'I now know what your address is'. When both nodes see this from
their peers they can have a little bus dialogue to confirm things,
after which they're in up-and-running mode. Or is the little dialogue
superfluous? 
</P>
<H3>Alan Robinson</H3>
<P>I'm beginning to have a vision thing. The various threads led by
Pertti Tapola on the MERG list and this discussion here seem to me to
be converging on something most interesting. 
</P>
<P>Pertti began with wondering how a distributed modular NX routing
panel might be made. Now the discussion is broadening into how trains
might be automatically controlled. Very soon we'll have ideas for all
the components of a totally automated layout run entirely by standard
general-purpose software. 
</P>
<P>Humans and scripted timetables generate route requests. The
modules provide the signalling. With track occupancy detection, you
know not only the route (block lengths, speed limits, number of
blocks ahead unoccupied, even gradients if you want!) but where on
its route each train is. In other words, you've got a complete
electronic 'driver's eye' view of the line ahead of each train. A
piece of automatic driver software, constantly updated with what's
ahead of each train, sends packets to a DCC command station to
control them. The driver software doesn't need to know anything about
the rest of the layout: just the line ahead. The only configuration
it needs is train characteristics. 
</P>
<P>Because it contains both signalman-centred and driver-centred
elements, it removes the difficulties of using DCC with automation.
I've been wondering how you might do that for a while. If you're
ahead of me there, I apologise! 
</P>
<P>A system like this allows NX routing. It allows very realistic
automated operation. It allows a mixture of scripted-timetable and
ad-hoc workings. It allows a mixture of automated trains and manually
controlled trains. And it allows throttles to show a human driver
what's ahead. 
</P>
<P>Few people would want all that capability of course, but a system
that can do it ought to be capable of anything, which why it appeals
to me. Especially throttles with graphic displays of the line ahead,
which I guess would find a larger market than automation. 
</P>
<H3>Bob Jacobsen</H3>
<P>…</P>
<P>The advantage of using a 1-wire memory chip to hold the data is
that it can be electrically isolated from everything else that's
going on. The sender powers it over the single-wire+ground
connection. That greatly reduces problems with ground offsets, etc. 
</P>
<P>…</P>
<P>&quot;port number&quot; isn't really a OpenLCB concept at the
moment, but the more I think about it, the more useful it seems for
this. 
</P>
<P>I was thinking that each &quot;end&quot; of a module would use a
different node or at least a different node number. That would then
be used for addressing, event IDs, etc. 
</P>
<P>Two node numbers in a single piece of hardware is a little
complex, though. 
</P>
<P>Better might be to define a port number (1 through 32? 1 through
255?), and then include that in EventIDs, datagrams, etc. Each 1-wire
connection sender advertises it's NodeID and port number; the
receiver can combine those to know what EventIDs to look for and
where to send datagrams. 
</P>
<P>…</P>
<P>Need to define a format for the exchanged data, and make sure it's
extensible for future things.</P>
<P>…</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Why is the broadcast message in (A) above needed, 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It implements the statement &quot;your connections are complete,
so you can start thinking now&quot;. I think you still want it, even
if you have a local activation, because there might be long-distance
effects in the information. I can't think of any at the moment, but
that doesn't mean they don't exist. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>and who sends it? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A circuit board with a CAN connection and a button, whose only
purpose in life is to do this. Or a computer. Or any of the special
&quot;Module Handler Node&quot; boards, when a special button on them
is pushed. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If the neighbour links are only ever used to send node ID
and port number, they could simply transmit them continuously. That
would fit in nicely with data validation by comparing successive
frames. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So how about this: the neighbour link protocol includes a
bit that says 'I now know what your address is'. When both nodes see
this from their peers they can have a little bus dialogue to confirm
things, after which they're in up-and-running mode. Or is the little
dialogue superfluous? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I like the idea of a completely local &quot;We're connected, so
lets come up&quot; mechanism. That would let pieces of a modular
layout be tested as they're connected together. 
</P>
<P>Having a &quot;are we really connected?&quot; dialog (or a
timeout: Have to keep getting data for 3 seconds to make sure the
connection has really been made) is a good idea. You need both the
1-wire and CAN connections up to succeed, so that's the thing to
test. 
</P>
<P>Also, it's got to handle the &quot;opps, hooked that up wrong,
this module needs to go over there!&quot; case. Maybe if a node
notices different information on the 1-wire, it starts over? (Can't
start over on loss-of-signal, because the next mode might just have
been turned off for a second) 
</P>
<H3>Alan Robinson</H3>
<P>Some more thoughts........ 
</P>
<OL START=11>
	<LI><P>Pertti's first idea of track control nodes was as physical
	entities. But the same entities (same code, even) could run on a PC.
	A mixture of both could work together. They could run on more than
	one PC (e.g. one per module). They just send messages to each other,
	and needn't know or care what hardware is hosting their peers. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>A use for automatic train driver software: throttles which
	can be switched in and out of autopilot. Scenario: Despatcher at
	module D and Receiver at module R between them request a route from
	D's yard to R's yard. When he gets the off, D drives the train
	manually out of his yard onto the main line, then switches his
	throttle to autopilot. If R is a long way from D the train is going
	to end up in an elephant parade. All handled automatically. Sometime
	after D has switched to autopilot, the train is handed from throttle
	D to throttle R, including the train characteristics info. To an
	observer of the train, the handover is completely seamless and
	unnoticeable. Someone at an intermediate module might set up a
	conflicting movement, and the train has to wait. All handled. All
	this may be going on completely out of sight of either D or R, who
	are now shunting their yards. Eventually, R gets notice that a route
	has been set up into his yard, so he knows the train is coming. D
	might have been a bit of a devil and not even told him what sort of
	train it is. Doesn't matter. When the train comes into view, R
	switches his throttle out of autopilot and drives the train manually
	into his yard. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>I reckon we've got the brains between us to work out all the
details and standards needed to achieve something like that. OpenLCB
could become something rather more than just a me-too rival to CBUS
or NMRAnet S9.5. 
</P>
<H3>David Harris</H3>
<P>There was mention on MERG about all-RF control of trains (but Alan
shut it down ;-) ).&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>I can see all RF coming, too. However, OpenLCB should be able to
adapt easily&nbsp;to these, since we are planning message-routing,
etc.
