A First Look</B></U></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>In 2010, model railroaders expect a lot from the
electronics on their layouts. They want to automate accessories,
simplify operation of their staging yards, have fine control over
layout lighting, and build realistic dispatcher panels. Home and club
layouts are getting more detailed and complicated, and existing
electronics for control systems are having a hard time keeping up.
OpenLCB is intended to be the next step forward, providing better
layout controls for the next twenty years.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4><U><B>What is OpenLCB?</B></U></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>OpenLCB is a messaging system that products can use
to help you control your model railroad in a simple manner, with less
wiring. It is a parallel system to the train control system, whether
that is DC or DCC. Although it is useful on small layouts, it is
powerful enough to control very large layouts, such as those in
museums or built by modular clubs. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>OpenLCB stands for 'Open Local Control Bus'. 'Open'
means that it is developed as an open-source connection standard.
Open, collaborative development is a great way for model railroaders
to get the products they want for their layouts. Like the DCC
standard, manufacturers and hobbyists can use the OpenLCB documents
and reference designs to create products to do all sorts of things,
while still ensuring that products from different companies will work
together. </FONT>

connects units called 'nodes', typically circuit boards which take
inputs, such as push-buttons and block detectors, and controls
outputs such as lights and switch-machines. The nodes send messages
to each other using a few wires run between them called a 'bus', that
acts as a party line. </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=4><U><B>Getting Started:</B></U></FONT></P>
<P><A HREF="drawings/SimplestPCExample.png"><IMG SRC="drawings/SimplestPCExample.png" NAME="Simplest P/C case" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=243 HEIGHT=116 BORDER=0></A><FONT SIZE=4>Simple
layouts might start with only a few nodes (boards), for example a set
of push-buttons that are used to control a set of turnouts (points).
In this case, one or more OpenLCB turnout-controller nodes and a
panel node, such as a multi-button node, and a power supply would be
needed. After the nodes are connected together with the bus cables,
as per their instructions, and are powered on, the nodes will all
listen on the bus. When a button is pushed, the button-node does send
a message on the bus to indicate that the button was pushed, which is
called an event. Other nodes are then taught to respond to that
message by causing something to happen, such as turning on a light,
changing a signal, or moving a turnout. </FONT>
</P>
<P><A HREF="drawings/NProducerExample.png"><IMG SRC="drawings/NProducerExample.png" NAME="Multiple producer example" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=243 HEIGHT=179 BORDER=0></A><FONT SIZE=4>Teaching
a node about how its connections respond depends on the node, but the
usual process is use buttons on one node to tell it to “learn”
the message for a particular output, and then going to another node
to tell it to “teach” the message for an input or output. From
then on, those will be connected together, and changes in the input
will drive the output. A button or toggle switch can drive a lamp or
turnout motor in another location. You can add other inputs and
outputs to that connection by just repeating the process, so that the
turnout responds to two buttons or a switch controls several lamps.</FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>This process is called the 'Producer/Consumer Model'.
The messages are called 'events'; the node that sends a particular
event is called a 'producer', because it produces the event; and the
node that acts upon it is called the 'consumer', because it consumes
the event. </FONT>

<P><A HREF="drawings/DayNightExample.png"><IMG SRC="drawings/DayNightExample.png" NAME="Day/Night example" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=212 BORDER=0></A><FONT SIZE=4>The
Producer/Consumer, or P/C, Model is very powerful. It allows one or
more producers to cause one or more consumers to perform actions.
However, its real power comes from the fact that neither the
producers, nor the consumers, need to know about any of the others. 
While it is obvious that a button press might cause a turnout to go
to the closed position, a single event can also allow two buttons at
opposite ends of the layout to control twenty-five turnouts, i.e. to
set a route. Events can represent such abstract concepts as “Set
the lighting to dawn”, or “Set the layout to mainline running”,
which can effect multiple different devices on the layout in
different ways. </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=4><U><B>Easily grow as far as you want:</B></U></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>While OpenLCB makes it simple to control small
layouts, it really shines as your layout grows. You can add new
devices to the layout without having to change the configuration of
any of the others. You don't have to think about addresses or board
numbers or command codes, because those are handled by the
producer/consumer connections. You can put together a couple devices
on your workbench, and later move them to the layout without worrying
about conflicts between addresses or having to keep track of which
channel numbers you've used already. </FONT>

OpenLCB puts most of the layout control in the nodes themselves,
without needing a computer, its also possible to connect a computer.
You might want one to use more advanced configuration tools that
don't require pushing buttons, to provide a glass dispatcher panel,
or use it for some other reason. The OpenLCB protocols have been
designed to easily connect to computers and home networks. Both USB
and Ethernet connections have already been developed, and others are
certainly possible. The OpenLCB protocols are also structured so that
a connected computer can rapidly learn the layout's setup and provide
useful tools, without a lot of separate configuration. OpenLCB gives
the computer the tools to do all the configuration &amp; control
tasks that people have learned to expect from programs like
DecoderPro, except now it's for their layout controls.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Although finished implementations aren't available
yet, OpenLCB is designed to connect with existing systems like
LocoNet, XpressNet, C/MRI, DCC, etc. For example, an OpenLCB
installation can connect to a pre-existing DCC system using a
“bridge” so that DCC accessory decoder operations (turnout
commands)   control OpenLCB nodes.</FONT></P>

OpenLCB nodes are connected using the commercial-standard “Control
Area Network bus” or CAN bus. CAN is an extremely robust
technology, used in applications from factory floors to
automobile-controls. Using a widely-available standard like this
makes is easy and cost-effective for manufacturers to build products
that work together. A single CAN bus cable can accommodate from 50-75
nodes spread out over 300-400 feet. Should your layout grow beyond
that, or you take your modules to a large modular meet, you can
control the layout with two bus-segments, and join them with a
bus-repeater. Using two segments makes each shorter, have less nodes,
and need less power. The bus-repeater node simply joins the two
halves together by moving the messages back and forth. The important
point is that you do not have to change anything else. All your
configuration is intact and you can just continue as you were. </FONT>

<P><A HREF="drawings/ModularLayoutsUseCase.png"><IMG SRC="drawings/ModularLayoutsUseCase.png" NAME="Large module layout" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=352 HEIGHT=272 BORDER=0></A><FONT SIZE=4><U><B>The
Future:</B></U></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Great care has been taken to design OpenLCB so that
it has lots of room to grow. It's intended to work for the very
largest modular layouts, and also to grow with the next 25 years of
model railroading. The twenty-year history of DCC provides lots of
examples of how creative model railroaders can think of new uses for
electronics. OpenLCB has lots of capability built in to keep up with
that for the next twenty years and more. For example, even though CAN
segments can only handle limited number of nodes and limited length,
OpenLCB provides the tools needed to create automatic bridges to
connect multiple CAN segments together without complicated
configuration or electrical issues. The messages and addresses used
on all segments never change. There's no need to reconfigure nodes to
another mode or with different software as the layout grows. Should
the layout outgrow even the capacity of CAN segments, OpenLCB allows
for the creation of “filtering” bridges that only move messages
to segments where they are needed. OpenLCB has even been designed to
include layout control over Ethernet or WiFi connections when the
ultimate in speed and convenience is desired. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4><U><B>Simplicity:</B></U></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>However, the biggest advantage to OpenLCB is not
apparent unless you compare it to other buses. Other buses require
the user to choose 'node IDs' and to ensure that no node has the same
ID. Similarly, you have to keep track of the numbers used to
represent events. This is quite easy on small layouts, reasonable on
larger layouts, but becomes very time-consuming on very large layouts
or layouts that are put together from multiple people's modules, such
as occurs at large meets of Fremo, Free-mo, Ntrak, oNeTrak, etc.
OpenLCB keeps track of node numbers, command and channel numbers, and
all that other book-keeping so that users never have to worry unless
they want to. This makes putting together large modular layouts more
efficient. You never have to reconfigure a module because its
addresses are already in use. Together with other advanced features,
OpenLCB lets these groups focus on enjoying their massive layouts. </FONT>

accessories together in a coherent whole in a simple manner that lets
model railroaders run their railroads. </FONT>
