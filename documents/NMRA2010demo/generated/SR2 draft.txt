   Introduction

    

   Didrik Voss has done a good job introducing Scale Rail readers to some of the issues involved in
   developing an accessory bus for model railroad layouts.  He outlined the history of DCC and his wish to
   develop a similar standard local control bus (LCB), and the initial mandate of the NMRA Net Working
   Group to be used as a guide to he development of such a bus.  

    

   He also described one of the proposals, S9.5, in the article.  This article is directed at filling in
   some of the gaps in the history and progress of the design process, and to describe how S9.6 differs
   from other proposed LCBs.    

    

   The planning for a open LCB started before the NMRAnet mandate ....

    

   The NMRAnet group developed some other documents to guide the development process and to aide in the
   evaluation of any subsequent proposals.  These were titled “Goals and Acceptance Criteria” and are as
   follows:

    1. Interoperable Products from one company can work with products from any other

       company, and with legacy systems.  

    2. No Central Control Products can interact with other products without the need for a central

       processor.

    3. Optional PC Control A PC can provide higher-level functionality, such as a CTC Interlocking,

       and system functions such as monitoring, testing, and debugging.

    4. Simple Make it easy for a novice customers to install and configure without  

       technical knowledge (should be easier than DCC systems).  

    5. Expandable Allow very large layouts (a higher-level of technical knowledge required is

       OK for large layouts).

    6. Flexible Customers can easily connect many-to-many devices, and connect to legacy

       systems.  

    7. Extensible Allow additional functionality to be added easily, whether by the NMRA, or

       manufacturers.

    8. Easy to Implement Easy and inexpensive to implement products that are reliable and

       compatible for vendors wishing to create products.

    9. Bi-directional Support bi-directional exchange of information.  

   10. Free IP The Standards and/or RPs should be free from intellectual-property

       restrictions from parties other than the NMRA.

   11. Transport Agnostic Allow different transport mechanisms for messages.

   12. Train Agnostic Support controlling trains when the network is connected to a train-control

       system.  

   13. Discoverable Allow a user to find out what devices are connected and how they’re

       configured on a layout.

   14. Self Describing Devices should describe themselves.

   15. Testable Allow components to be easily tested for compliance.

   16. Compliance A name protected by a trademark that NMRA can use to help ensure  

       compliance.

   17. First-Time Use A new user can buy a device and have it work.

   S9.6 / OpenLCB Proposal

    

   We have put a lot of thought about the hard problems, and how to design an integrated solution that will
   serve novices to experts, and small to large layouts.  We have concentrated on these areas:

    

    1. Simplicity for the first time user: A novice can buy two nodes, hook them together and start to
       teach them to interact.  

    2. Support for the large modular layout: S9.6 prevents conflict between modules and automates set-up.
        Meets do not need to pre-assign or keep lists of number.  

    3. Automatic traffic control and filtering: S9.6 has this built into the protocol and can use fast
       buses to interconnect multiple bus segments.  

    4. Cost effective: S9.6 efficiently bridges to legacy equipment maintaining your prior investments.

    5. Controlling complexity with tools.  

    

   Simplicity when things are new or small:

    

   S9.6 simplifies life for the novice.  Nodes come pre-loaded  with serial numbers from the factory.  The
   novice can simply plug nodes together, program them, and immediately control his accessories.  Nodes can
   be programmed with as few as two push-buttons using what we call the Blue-Gold method.  The diagram
   shows two simple nodes.  (insert real picture of a 4channel node).

    

   Support when things are big:

   Illustration 1: Fremo Meet in Europe

   S9.6 has ample room for growth, and can easily handle large layouts including museum layouts and large
   modular layouts, such as occur at annual meets of Ntrak in North America and Fremo in Europe., see the
   picture to the right).  Clubs nodes cannot conflict, even when multiple clubs get together with modules
   that were programmed at home, because all nodes have guaranteed different serial and event numbers.   In
   addition, none of the modules will need to be re-programmed since there is no chance of a conflict.  The
   exception to this is, of course, teaching some new interactions between the modules.  The meet's
   organizers will not have to keep lists of numbers, nor pre-allocate module numbers,  channels numbers,
   or events.  S9.6 also automates and simplifies the set-up and configuration of the modules, allowing the
   meet organizers to drill down into the individual modules, if necessary.   

    

   Correcting when things are too full or too busy:

   S9.6 can start as one segment consisting of two nodes or multiple segments connected by a fast S9.6 bus.
    If a segment gets too many nodes, or too much traffic, it can be split into two segments.  Multiple
   segments can be joined by repeater- or bridge-nodes that can automatically filter and route traffic to
   just those segments and nodes that need it.  

    

   Protect your investment:

    

   S9.6 let's you keep using your legacy equipment.  Intelligent bridges connect to it and integrate its
   devices right into the S9.6 protocol by including the it inside S9.6's messages.  For example, DCC
   accessory commands are converted to S9.6 events and they can address accessories on the LCB.   Other
   buses expected to be supported are Loconet, Xpressnet, NCR's throttle bus and  C\MRI.    

    

   Control when things are complex:

    

   Layouts have a habit of growing, both in extent and in complexity.  The S9.6 group has designed S9.6 to
   allow multiple computers to connect to your layout to help design, configure, debug, and if you want, to
   operate your layout.  

    

    

   How does it all work?

    

   Big Node Numbers

    

   Each S9.6 node has an identifying number called its ID, which is essentially its serial number, which is
   unique to it in the whole world.  This means that you do not need to supply an ID for it, and will never
   have to deal directly with it.  S9.6 node IDs are 48-bit numbers, and each anyone that builds S9.6 nodes
   is given a large batch of serial numbers that they can assign to their nodes.  Each manufacturer is
   assigned IDs, and even you, if you want to build your own nodes, has reserved series of IDs.    

    

   Big Events

    

   The main workhorse on a S9.6 LCB is event, which is represented by a number that is unique to that event
   (yes, in the whole world).  One or more nodes can send this event number in a message (producers), and
   all the nodes with the matching event-number will listen (consumers).  For example, two buttons on
   either side of a peninsula might set the turnouts in a station to the main line, or a BOD might turn a
   signal red.  

    

   One of the main differences between S9.6 and other buses is that we use very big event numbers which are
   64-bits.  This has some distinct advantages to the user: nodes can automatically assign a unique event
   number whenever one is needed, you do not need to think one up nor record it.  Any node can teach its
   events to any other node(s), whether it or they be consumers or producers, in one teaching session.  

    

   Another advantage is we can place such things as fast-time, RFID numbers, and other bus's messages right
   inside S9.6 events, letting nodes respond to these just like any other event, without needing any extra
   programming to make it happen.

    

    

   A message for all sizes of messages

    

   Besides events, S9.6 also uses datagrams and streams to carry larger messages.  Datagrams can send up to
   72 bytes of information between two nodes in a single operation.  Streams can send  messages from one
   node to another continuously.  

    

   Control of size and of traffic

    

   Layouts will grow to the point where there is too many nodes on it or too much traffic.  S9.6 is
   designed to alleviate both of these problems.  The solution to too many nodes is to split the bus into
   segments.  S9.6 was designed from the ground up run efficiently on a segmented bus.  It use of a large
   flat ID-space simplifies the problems inherent in this situation, without the need to extend the node or
   event IDs, as in other schemes.  

    

   While CAN will likely be used in small and medium sized layouts, we believe that a faster bus will be
   required.  For this reason, S9.6 is also implemented on Ethnernet.  This allows the connection of
   multiple CAN segments through gateways.  To help with traffic overload, S9.6 implements automatic
   analysis, filtering and routing of message traffic such that messages only go to nodes and segments that
   need them – this is called interest-based routing – and reduces segment traffic to mostly local
   messages.
