                                                1 Introduction

   "Function Description Information" (FDI) in this context refers to fixed information available from an
   OpenLCB Train Node, via OpenLCB, so that other devices can properly and correctly operate it.

    

   Other information may be available via e.g. manuals or the Internet, but the format of that information
   is not under specification here.

    

   A key use for FDI is to enable an OpenLCB throttle to determiine the features provided by a Train Node’s
   functions. The throttle will use the FDI information to render some form of suitable Graphical User
   Interface to allow the user to easily and intuitively operate the functions provided by the Train Node

    

   An important design choice was to embed the FDI into each node so that the system has all it needs to
   operate the Train Node without having to source the information externally to the OpenLCB network from
   the manufacturer or some other on-line repository via the Internet or a CD/DVD etc. An OpenLCB throttle
   is not required to have an Internet connection.

    

1.1 Requirements

     * Train Nodes must carry enough context that a stand-alone throttle can provide a useful human
       interface without getting any data from an external source, e.g. needing an Internet download or the
       user entering or uploading a database.

1.2 Preferences

     * Train Nodes shouldn't need a lot of processing power, e.g. to compress or decompress data in real
       time. Memory usage should also be limited, but is a second priority.

     * The necessary OpenLCB operations should be state-less and idempotent to simplify software at both
       ends.

                                        2 Annotations to the Standard

2.1 Introduction

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

   The concept and interaction are using the same pattern and similar format as the Configuration
   Description Information, purposefully, with the expectation that OpenLCB devices will be able to share
   the software implementation between these two use-cases.

2.2 Intended Use

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

   The most important use-case of operating a model train is controlling speed and functions. The protocol
   for these are defined in the OpenLCB Train Control protocol Standard. The user typically uses a Throttle
   for performing these operations, either as a special-purpose hardware device, or as a software function
   on a generic computing device.

   While the semantic meaning of speed control is very well defined, the meaning of functions is left very
   vague by the OpenLCB Train Control standard, just like other standards of the industry; a function is
   some form of remote controlled feature of the train (or locomotive). This vague definition is
   intentional, as manufacturers have come up with new and innovative ideas on what kind of additional
   features they want to add to their models, and the typical way to operate these features is using the
   function abstraction.

   Typical functions are lighting functions (like headlights, tail lights, class marker lights, etc.),
   motor control functions (momentum, braking, etc.), sound functions (horn, bell, whistle, engine sounds,
   compressor, etc.) and a variety of other functions, such as a smoke unit, raising and lowering a
   pantograph or operating a locomotive-mounted remote uncoupler. There is no definitive list of all
   possible functions. The TN-2181 document by RailCommunity lists over 120 different types.

   Not only is the list of possibilities is very large, one specific model alone can carry dozens of
   different  functions. Users of proprietary throttles have to activate these typically by their function
   number, for example using a numeric keypad. This is easy to operate, provided that the user has
   memorized  which function number does what on that specific locomotive. With dozens of functions per
   locomotive and up to hundreds of locomotives on a big layout, this is no easy task. As such, it is an
   important use-case for the OpenLCB Throttle to display a user interface that provides information to the
   user about what function numbers are available, and which numbers perform what operations on the train.

   The Function Description Information (FDI) provides exactly this metadata for the throttle: the list of
   functions, for each function the number at which it is accessible, and a textual description of what the
   given function does.

   In addition to the description for the user, the throttle user interface needs some additional metadata
   to determine how the particular function button should behave. There are two common behaviors for on/off
   functions: momentary functions are turned on while the user is holding the button, and turned off upon
   release. Toggle (or binary) functions are turned on with a press of the button, then they stay on after
   release, until the user presses the button again. A typical momentary function is horn, a typical toggle
   function is headlight. This is purely a behavior of the user interface, as the underlying protocol for
   turning the function on and off is the same for both cases. Analog functions, such as a horn volume or
   pitch, take a numerical value to control their operation.

2.3 Reference and Context

   The Memory Configuration Protocol is one way to retrieve the FDI, but FDI is independent of that.
   Download of this data via a direct BLE transfer offering a similar capability would make this
   specification equally applicable.

    

2.4 Content

   The function description information for a Train Node is invariant while the node has any OpenLCB
   connections in the Initialized state. The Train Node’s transition back to Initialized state via sending
   an Initialization Complete global message tells other nodes to flush their caches and pick up any
   changed content.

   There are no default values that e.g. associate "Bell" with a particular location or function. These are
   thought to be too brittle, and there are just too many possibilities to be useful.

2.5 Format

   The structure is somewhat similar to the Configuration Definition Information structure, with named
   sections that organize and describe individual items.

   The use of XML 1.0 format is intended to make the content as easy as possible to parse.

   The use of XML Schema 1.0 is intended to allow the use of common XML parsers. Note that the schema
   definition file includes an XML Schema 1.1 check for extensibility that has been commented out so that
   the operational schema remains valid Schema 1.0.

  2.5.1 XML Elements

    

   Note that nothing in the Standard prevents providing an xml-stylesheet instruction, and it’s common to
   provide one of the form:

   <?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='xslt/fdi.xsl'?>

    2.5.1.1 <fdi> Element

   The <fdi> element forms the root of the document.  It provides the “xmlns:xsi” and
   “xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation” attributes that define the schema for automated processing.

    2.5.1.2 <segment> Element

   The <segment> element is provided for future extensibility.  The "space" and "origin" attributes are
   carried over from the Configuration Description Information format, but at the present state of the
   standard, there is no way to express a different memory space than 0xF9. Similarly, the layout of
   offsets in the memory space is not defined today. If a future version of this standard provides such
   capabilities, then the "space" and "origin" attributes may be used in a backwards-compatible way, with
   0xF9 and 0 being their respective defaults. They should be omitted in current implementations.

    2.5.1.3 <group> Element

   Groups may contain one or more inner groups, with the same representation. This may continue to any
   desired level.

   Note that unlike in the CDI standard, groups can not be specified with a repetition count in the FDI.
   The reason for this is that individual functions are addressed by the <number> sub-element, and
   repeating a group is not meaningful, because that sub-element would remain the same.

    2.5.1.4 <function> Element

   The “kind” attribute is an enumerated type of (currently) "binary", “momentary”, and "analog".

    

   The “number” element indicates which function is being described by this element. This value is to be
   used in the Train Control Protocol Set Function operation in the "address" field. That field is 24 bits,
   therefore the maximum value in this element is 16777215.

   Note that there is no requirement on the ordering of the <function> elements with respect to their
   <number>. It is not required for functions to be listed in ascending order by number, and it is not
   required for every function number in a range to be present (i.e., numbers can be skipped). A function
   number not listed in the FDI is assumed by throttles to be doing nothing (i.e., not presented on a UI
   having a list of functions).

   The “name” and “icon” elements provide information which can be used if the throttle has e.g. a
   graphical interface to the user.

   The “size” attribute is optionally allowed for compatibility with some early, pre-Standard
   implementations.  It should be omitted in current and future implementations.

                                           3 Additional Information

3.1 Design points

   Basic configuration is done with the configuration protocol defined elsewhere.

   Function values are stored in the 0xF9 memory space. They can be addressed through the Train Control
   protocol’s Set Function and Query Function commands. The Memory Configuration Protocol can also be used
   to read and write the memory space 0xF9, if that is implemented. This allows reading a large number of
   functions with a single request. However, while the Train Control Protocol Set Function has 16 bits
   available to represent a function's value, in the memory space 0xF9 there is only 1 byte per function
   address; the default value of deprecated attribute 'size' being 1 represents this. There is no
   resolution for this discrepancy in the current Standard.

3.2 Sample Function Definition XML:

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>

    <?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='xslt/fdi.xsl'?>

    <fdi xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
   xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation='https://openlcb.org/schema/fdi/1/0/fdi.xsd'>

    

    <segment>

      <group>

        <name>Lighting Functions</name>

        <description>Headlights and Marker lights and Running lights, oh my.</description>

        <function kind="binary">

          <name>Headlights</name>

          <number>0</number>

          <max>2</max>

        </function>

      </group>

    </segment>

    </fdi>

    

3.3 Sample Older Implementation

   A sample older implementation of the DCC F0-F28 functions, with some optional attributes still in place:

   <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>

   <?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='xslt/fdi.xsl'?>

   <fdi xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
   xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation='https://openlcb.org/schema/fdi/1/0/fdi.xsd'>

   <segment origin='0' space='249'>

     <group>

       <name>F0-F28</name>

       <description>Standard DCC functions</description>

       <function size="1" kind="binary">

         <name>Headlight</name>

         <number>0</number>

       </function>

       <function size="1">

         <number>1</number>

       </function>

       ...

       <function size="1">

         <number>28</number>

       </function>

     </group>

   </segment>

   </fdi>

    

    

                                            4 Possible Future Work

   This section discusses some areas where future work may be desired.  It is meant as a record of the
   discussions to date, not as defining any specific solution(s).

4.1 Data Compression

   Some work has gone into XML content compression for the Configuration Description Information (CDI)
   data.  See the CDI Technical Note for various considerations that have been discussed.  A solution
   there, if developed, standardized and deployed, could also be used here.

   The function definition information is expected to be significantly smaller than a Train Node’s CDI, so
   there may be less need to compress the FDI. On the other hand, CDI gets retrieved relatively rarely
   (only when a user intends to modify configuration), whereas FDI gets retrieved regularly as part of
   normal operations of a model railroad.

4.2 Internationalization of the Content

   Not everybody runs their trains in English.

   The xml:lang attribute could be used to define versions of the <name> and <description> elements that
   use an alternate language.2 This approach can greatly increase the size of the XML content if the
   internationalization effort is very successful. On the other hand, it’s transparent to XML-using nodes
   that don’t implement internationalization.

4.3 Machine-readable function classification

   Expressing the function’s type in a free-text form in the <name> element has a wide expressibility, but
   presents challenges for user interface development:

     * Text generally needs to be rendered with a font size that is readable for the given user.

     * Long text takes a significant amount of screen real-estate.

     * Text display assumes the user can read, which excludes children under a certain age.

   Instead of this, a variety of competing model railroad systems define function types which are then
   represented by appropriate icons. The icons can be standardized in size, and convey significantly more
   information on a given real estate than text. This limits the user's choice (there is a fixed number of
   different icons provided by the implementation usually), but a larger number of functions will fit on
   the user interface than in a text version.

   In order to add machine-readable function type, an enumeration is needed that lists possible function
   types and assigns numbers to them. There is such as the list in section 3 of the TN-218 by
   RailCommunity. This is then used in the <icon> element for transmitting the function enumeration in the
   FDI.

   In the future, the NMRA may define a set of icons as part of their DCC work.  A future migration to
   those standard icons is possibly desirable, but will require work to ensure backward compatibility.

   Note that the <icon> element is defined in terms of the TN-218 function names.  TN-218 doesn’t provide
   actual icons for these names.  It may be useful to provide a list of sample graphics with some future
   work. The size, resolution, color palette, etc of these sample icons needs careful consideration.
