                                                         Simple Node Information Protocol

                                                   Feb 10, 2015                       In Review             

                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This document defines the OpenLCB Simple Node Information Protocol, a light-weight method to request
   identification information from an OpenLCB node. The information returned is a few specific
   human-readable strings that allow the user to recognize the particular node, as well as supplying data
   to user interfaces to represent nodes.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   This Standard defines an optional protocol. Nodes may, but are not required to, implement this protocol.

   The protocol does not depend on any transport layer protocol (such as Datagrams or Streams), thus the
   simplicity and low complexity makes it ideally suited to implement even in smaller nodes, such as Simple
   nodes.

   A typical use of this protocol is for network browsers and configuration tools, which present the entire
   network with all its nodes to the user. When the user selects a node from a list, the human-readable
   strings as returned by this protocol could be used to represent the node instead of the 48-bit unique
   Node ID.

   Nodes which have a user interface for selecting other nodes for interaction (e.g. a throttle selecting a
   train to operate) may also use the data supplied by this protocol to display to the user the selected or
   selectable nodes.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   This is in the context of the following OpenLCB Standards:

     * The OpenLCB Message Network Standard, which defines the basic messages and how they interact, as
       well as how the messages are represented on a CAN network, including how to transport long messages
       in multiple CAN frames. The Message Network Standard also specifies the Protocol Support Inquiry and
       Protocol Support Reply messages, which are referenced here.

     * The OpenLCB Memory Configuration Protocol may be used alternatively to request overlapping or
       identical information from a node as provided by this standard. The OpenLCB Configuration
       Description Information (CDI) Standard defines how to interpret the configuration information. A
       specific option is ACDI, which, if present gives access to the same information as the Simple Node
       Information Protocol via the Memory Configuration Protocol, but can also be used to change the
       user-provided information.

                                        4 Message Formats (Normative)

4.1 Simple Node Information Request

                                                                               Common                       
                    Name                   Simple Node   Dest ID   Event ID                Data Content
                                                                                 MTI     

    Simple Node Information Request             N           Y          N       0x0DE8          none         

   This message requests the destination node to send the Simple Node Information data to the source node.

4.2 Simple Node Information Reply

                                                                              Common                        
                   Name                  Simple Node    Dest ID   Event ID                 Data Content
                                                                                MTI     

    Simple Node Information Reply             N            Y          N       0x0A08      payload bytes     

   This reply carries the Simple Node Information payload from the target node to the requesting node.

                                         5 Payload Format (Normative)

5.1 Format

   The reply payload is a sequence of bytes which is a concatenation of the following entries without any
   separator. The entries are of fixed or variable length.

     * The byte 0x01 or 0x04 to indicate the version of the following content

     * A null-terminated string for manufacturer name of no more than 41 bytes including terminating null.

     * A null-terminated string for node model name of no more than 41 bytes including terminating null.

     * A null-terminated string for node hardware version of no more than 21 bytes including terminating
       null.

     * A null-terminated string for node software version of no more than 21 bytes including terminating
       null.

     * The byte 0x01 or 0x02 to indicate the version of the following content

     * A null-terminated string for user-provided node name of no more than 63 bytes including terminating
       null.

     * A null-terminated string for user-provided node description of no more than 64 bytes including
       terminating null.

5.2 Versioning

   Future versions of this standard may extend the number of null-terminated strings in each of the two
   sections. In such case the version number at the beginning of the sections will be set to the number of
   null-terminated strings presented in the particular section.

   Nodes must therefore accept data with either of the version numbers as presented in Section 5.1.

                                          6 Interactions (Normative)

6.1 Discovery

   If a node supports the Simple Node Information Protocol, then the node must indicate so in the Protocol
   Support Reply message as defined by the OpenLCB Message Network Standard.

6.2 Request and reply

   The requesting node sends a Simple Node Information Request message addressed to the destination node.
   The destination node should reply with one or more messages, each possibly being in one or more parts
   (frames), whose data content concatenated forms the payload, as defined in Section 5.1.

   Nodes implementing the Simple Node Information Protocol should prefer sending the reply in one message
   in multiple frames instead of sending multiple messages. Nodes requesting must be able to process
   replies arriving in one or more messages, each having single or multiple frames.

   Nodes requesting data via the Simple Node Information Request message must wait for the entire reply to
   arrive before sending another Simple Node Information Request to the same destination node.

6.3 Stability

   The information presented in the Simple Node Information Reply has to be constant. If the information
   changes, the node must enter Initialized state again and send out a Node Initialization Complete message
   (as defined by the OpenLCB Message Network Standard) to inform nodes that the information they may have
   cached needs to be refreshed.

                                         7 CAN Adaptation (Normative)

   There are no specific provisions for CAN transport. The messages are formatted on CAN transport as
   defined for generic addressed messages in the OpenLCB Message Network Standard. In particular, refer to
   the encoding of the nibble 'f' in the first data byte on CAN representing how individual frames of
   longer messages have to be encoded.
