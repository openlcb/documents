                                                                    Event Transport

                                                        Feb 6, 2016                      Adopted            

                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This OpenLCB Standard defines the protocol for transporting OpenLCB events across the OpenLCB network.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Transporting events provides general and flexible messaging between nodes, following the principles of
   the Producer-Consumer model. The information is carried by an Event Identifier (Event ID), a number
   which in of itself does not have any explicit information. Instead the Event ID is assigned by the user
   to one specific concept, such as a specific lighting configuration, or a more abstract concept, such as
   the “start of the day” or “global stop”. That concept can then be implemented and shared by cooperative
   action between nodes that “produce” the event by sending messages, and nodes that “consume” the event by
   receiving messages and acting upon them. This document defines that interaction between producers and
   consumers in terms of OpenLCB messages.

   This document describes the required message formats for event transport. Section 4 gives an overview of
   the message types with an abstract numeric description intended as a normative guide to the construction
   of concrete message types over specific physical transport media. Section 7 describes in concrete detail
   the implementation of the event transport message formats for the specific physical transport media that
   have been adopted as normative standards.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   This standard is in the context of the following OpenLCB Standards:

     * The OpenLCB Message Network Standard, which defines the basic messages and how they interact.
       Higher-level protocols are based on this message network, but are defined elsewhere. The Message
       Network Standard defines the Initialized node state which is referenced here.

     * The OpenLCB Event Identifiers Standard, which defines the format and content of Event IDs including
       the class of Well-Known Event IDs and Automatically-Routed Event IDs.

     * The OpenLCB CAN Frame Transport Standard, which defines the formats for transporting OpenLCB
       messages over CAN networks.

                                        4 Message Formats (Normative)

   In the following, the “Common MTI” column specifies the MTI value to be used when communicating in
   OpenLCB common format. The Common MTI is an abstract numeric description intended as a normative guide
   to the construction of concrete message formats over specific physical transport media.

   “Event ID Range” in the Data Content field refers to a range of Event ID values specified through a
   compare-under-mask operation. The low bit of the field defines the sign of the mask: a '1'
   least-significant bit indicates the mask is represented by 1-bits, and similarly for a 0 LSB. The mask
   is made up of the adjacent identical bits: if the lowest bit is a '0', then all low order contiguous '0'
   bits will form a mask, while if the lowest bit is a '1', then the low order contiguous '1' bits will
   form the mask. The remaining upper bits determine the range prefix. To determine whether an Event ID “E”
   lies within the range “R”, compute:

   inRange = ( (E AND NOT mask) EQUALS (R AND NOT mask) )

              Name             Simple Node       Dest ID     Event ID                     Data Content
                                                                             MTI      

    Learn Event                       Y             N            Y         0x0594           Event ID        

                                             5 States (Normative)

   Each consumer and producer of each event has two possible states: “Unadvertised” and “Advertised”.

   When the node hosting the producer or consumer is not in Initialized state, the consumer or producer
   shall be in and remain in Unadvertised state.

   A producer or consumer of a specific event moves to Advertised state when any of the following happens:

     * The producer or consumer sends a Producer Identified or Consumer Identified, respectively, message
       containing the Event ID.

     * The producer or consumer sends a Producer Range Identified or Consumer Range Identified,
       respectively, message where the indicated range contains the Event ID.

     * Producers and consumers of Event IDs in the Automatically-Routed range are in the Advertised state
       once the node is in the Initialized state.

   The messages defined by this Standard shall only be sent when the sending node is in Initialized state.

   Producer/Consumer Event Report messages may only be sent when the associated producer is in the
   Advertised state. OpenLCB equipment may, but is not required to, omit forwarding PCER messages to a
   consumer of a particular Event ID when that consumer is in Unadvertised state.

   Consumers and Producers may, but are not required to, have additional state associated with the use of
   the Learn Event message.

                                          6 Interactions (Normative)

   After each transition to Initialized State and before sending a Producer/Consumer Event Report (PCER)
   message producing a specific Event ID outside the automatically-routed Event ID range, a node shall
   transition to Advertised state for that Event ID by emitting a Producer Identified or Producer Range
   Identified message identifying that Event ID.

   To ensure receipt of PCER messages, a node consuming a specific Event ID outside the
   automatically-routed Event ID shall transition to Advertised state for that Event ID by emitting a
   Consumer Identified or Consumer Range Identified message identifying that Event ID.

6.1 Event Transfer

   To produce an event, the node containing the producer shall emit a PCER message containing the specific
   Event ID. The OpenLCB message network shall transport that message to all attached nodes, except as
   described in the next paragraph. Nodes containing consumers shall check for a match between the message
   Event ID and their consumers. If a match is found, the consumer shall perform any local operations
   configured into it. If a match is not found, the consumer shall not perform any local operations.

   Equipment that transports PCER messages shall transport them to all connected nodes from which the
   equipment has received a Consumer Identified or Consumer Range Identified for the reported Event ID.
   Equipment that transports PCER messages shall transport all PCER messages containing Event IDs in the
   automatically-routed range to all connected nodes. Equipment that transports PCER messages may, but is
   not required to, omit transporting PCER messages with Event ID outside the automatically-routed range to
   nodes from which the equipment has not received a Consumer Identified or Consumer Range Identified for
   the reported Event ID.

6.2 Event Inquiry

   Upon receipt of either an unaddressed (global) Identify Events message or an addressed Identify Events
   message addressed to the node, that node shall reply with Producer Identified and/or Producer Range
   Identified messages covering all non-automatically-routed Event IDs produced by the node, and Consumer
   Identified and/or Consumer Range Identified messages covering all non-automatically-routed Event IDs
   consumed by the node.

   In response to an unaddressed (global) Identify Events message or an addressed Identify Events message
   address to the node, that node may but is not required to include Producer Identified and/or Producer
   Range Identified messages covering automatically-routed Event IDs produced by the node, and Consumer
   Identified and/or Consumer Range Identified messages covering automatically-routed Event IDs consumed by
   the node.

6.3 Producer Inquiry

   Any node receiving an Identify Producer message that includes a non-automatically-routed Event ID
   produced by the node shall reply with one or more Producer Identified messages containing that Event ID.

   Any node receiving an Identify Producer message that includes an automatically-routed Event ID produced
   by the node may, but is not required to, reply with one or more Producer Identified messages containing
   that Event ID.

6.4 Consumer Inquiry

   Any node receiving an Identify Consumer message that includes a non-automatically-routed Event ID
   consumed by the node shall reply with one or more Consumer Identified messages containing that Event ID.

   Any node receiving an Identify Consumer message that includes an automatically-routed Event ID consumed
   by the node may, but is not required to, reply with one or more Consumer Identified messages containing
   that Event ID.

6.5 Teach/Learn Configuration

   A node may, but is not required to, send a Teach Event message containing an Event ID.

   A node receiving a Teach Event message may, but is not required to, configure the contained Event ID
   into some or all of the producers and consumers it contains.

6.6 Resetting to Default

   Nodes shall ensure that every producer and consumer within the node contains a valid and unique Event ID
   after the node is reset to defaults. For this purpose, the producers and consumers may contain either
   well-known Event IDs or Event IDs defined based on this node's unique ID.

   If a producer or consumer within the node contains an Event ID based on the node's unique ID, and if
   that Event ID could have been copied from the node, resetting the node to default shall reconfigure that
   producer or consumer with a newly-defined Event ID that has not been used before.

                                         7 CAN Adaptation (Normative)

   There are no specific provisions for CAN transport. The messages are formatted on CAN transport as
   defined for generic addressed messages in the OpenLCB Message Network Standard.
