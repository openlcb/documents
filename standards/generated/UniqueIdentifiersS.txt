                                                                   Unique Identifiers

                                                        Feb 6, 2016                      Adopted            

                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This standard describes the format and allocation of OpenLCB 48-bit Unique Identifiers. It is not
   specific to any wire protocol.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Many OpenLCB protocols rely on each node having a Node ID, and those Node IDs being absolutely unique
   between nodes. OpenLCB defines 48-bit unique identifiers for this purpose. Unique Identifiers are also
   used to ensure that Event Identifiers are uniquely specified. This Standard is intended to ensure these
   Unique Identifiers are available. It applies to all OpenLCB uses of 48-bit Unique Identifiers, including
   as Node Identifiers.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   This specification is in the context of the following OpenLCB Standards:

     * The OpenLCB Message Network Standard, which defines the basic messages and how they interact.
       Higher-level protocols are based on this message network, but are defined elsewhere.

     * The OpenLCB Event Identification Standard, which defines the well-known Events Identifiers.

                                             4 Format (Normative)

   An OpenLCB Unique Identifier (Unique ID) shall be six bytes of eight bits each.

   The order of bytes in an OpenLCB unique Identifier shall be considered significant. The most-significant
   byte shall be transmitted first during communication operations. The most-significant byte shall be
   written first (left-most in Western format) in any human-readable representation. Within the tables
   below, byte 1 is considered the most-significant byte, while byte 6 is considered the least significant
   byte.

   An OpenLCB Unique Identifier shall include one or more 1 bits.

   Every OpenLCB node shall have a Unique Identifier to use as a Node Identifier (Node ID).

                                           5 Allocation (Normative)

   Unique Identifiers shall be allocated using one of the mechanisms in this section. When additional
   allocation methods are defined, the Unique Identifiers defined by those additional methods shall only
   provide allocation ranges that do no overlap with existing allocation ranges. Ranges that are not
   explicitly allocated are reserved for future use unless otherwise noted within this document.

5.1 Overview

   Unique Identifiers are allocated in groups starting with the most significant byte as the macro group
   assignment.

5.4 Manufacturer Specific

   Manufacturers shall ensure uniqueness for identifiers they assign. Short (8-bit) NMRA DCC manufacture
   ID's are assigned out of this pool. Please see section 5.11 for long (16-bit) NMRA DCC manufacture ID's.
   Some of the DCC manufacture ID's are called out specifically in the table below as an example and to
   draw attention to their existence, but they are assigned in accordance with their corresponding DCC
   manufacture ID. This pool may also be used for new, unique, non-DCC manufacture ID based assignments in
   the future.

   definition of ranges for additional groups will use unique values in Byte 2.

5.6 Assigned by Software at Runtime

   A program running in a computer with an IP address must not use that address to directly formulate a
   unique identifier. The program may use an IP connection to request a unique identifier from openlcb.org,
   or from another organization that is distributing unique identifiers from a range designated to it.

5.8 Locomotive Control Systems

   This Unique Identifier range (starting with a most significant byte value of 0x06) was originally
   allocated for locomotive control systems. These allocations are no longer valid, because locomotive
   control is being implemented differently than originally conceived. These allocations are known to have
   never been used other than for experimental purposes. For historical reasons, the values are displayed
   here. Do not use these Unique Identifiers for any reason, as their use has been deprecated, and they may
   be re-designated for another purpose in the future.

5.9 RFID and NFC

   The RFID Unique Identifiers space is reserved for further standardization in the future. Do not use this
   space before contacting the OpenLCB organization first.

5.10 Temporary Assigned by Software at Runtime

   This range has been reserved for specialized software and network services specifically designed to
   lease a Unique Identifier to nodes upon request. Nodes that come without a Unique Identifier (such as
   computer programs) may contact an instance of such leasing service to obtain a Unique Identifier. Nodes
   may use any method outside the OpenLCB network to locate and communicate with a leasing service (for
   example an Internet connection or a local TCP/IP network). The leases shall be limited in time, and a
   node shall not use an identifier after the lease time expires. The node may communicate with the leasing
   service to periodically extend the lease.

   Each such service shall operate from a range assigned to the specific instance, and is responsible for
   ensuring uniqueness among its clients. The owner or maintainer of an OpenLCB Installation is responsible
   for ensuring that all the leasing services that all the nodes participating in the installation are
   using, have disjoint ranges. In particular, if the Installation operates one or more leasing services,
   they must be assigned disjoint ranges to hand out identifiers from. Globally available leasing services
   (such as over the Internet) shall have a unique range assigned to them.

   Because Unique Event Identifiers assigned out of this range could be captured and disseminated into use
   by nodes that could become unaware of a lease expiration and reassignment, Unique Event Identifiers
   shall not be assigned out of this range.

   It is possible that a future OpenLCB protocol may, or may not, define a mechanism to negotiate a Unique
   Identifier lease over an OpenLCB network. It is important to note that no such protocol is prescribed by
   this standard.

   Manufacturers shall ensure uniqueness for identifiers they assign. Long (8-bit) NMRA DCC manufacture
   ID's are assigned out of this pool. Some of the DCC manufacture ID's are called out specifically in the
   table below as an example and to draw attention to their existence, but they are assigned in accordance
   with their corresponding DCC manufacture ID.
