                                                1 Introduction

   This Technical Note contains informative discussion and background for the corresponding OpenLCB
   Standard. This Technical Note is not normative in any way.

                                        2 Annotations to the Standard

   This section provides background information on corresponding sections of the OpenLCB CAN Standard
   document. It's expected that the two documents will be read together.

2.1 Intended Use

   Users can expect to be able to form networks within limitations. For example, reliable operations on a
   single CAN segment is subject to multiple limitations, including:

     * Maximum CAN segment cable length is 1000 ft / 300m

     * The max cable length is reduced by 20 ft / 6m for each physical node attached to the segment

     * The max cable length is further reduced by double the length of each stub cable attached to the
       segment

     * There may never be less than 1 ft / 30cm of cable between nodes, nor between a stub connection and a
       node.

   This implies that there is a limit of about 48 nodes on a single segment.

   These expectations are based on CAN documentation, component-vendor specifications & application notes,
   and industrial experience with CAN. The intent is to set expectations that can be met essentially all of
   the time. The Standard does not restrict users from building, or attempting to build, networks that
   exceed these expectations. Often, OpenLCB CAN layouts that somewhat exceed these expectations will be
   able to operate reliably.

   These expectations are based on UTP/RJ45 wiring of equipment that conforms to the Standard. Wiring
   and/or equipment that exceeds the Standard may result in being able to reliably build larger networks;
   alternate wiring or equipment may work well on smaller networks, but may not be able to reach the
   network sizes listed in that section.

   Manufacturers may want to use CAN transceiver chips with either reduced load, or increased drive
   capability relative to the CAN specification.

     * The CAN specifications require the receiver input impedance R_diff must be 10k ohms or greater.
       Transceivers with e.g. 20k ohm input impedance reduce the total bus load and can allow significantly
       more nodes. They will generally not allow greater maximum lengths.

     * The CAN transmitter output drive capability is expressed as a minimum bus resistance of 45 ohms. Bus
       transmitters with improved drive capability, e.g. 42.5 ohms, can allow significantly more nodes
       because the bus termination resistance provides much of the total load. Improved transmitters will
       generally not allow greater maximum lengths.

   The Standard permits, but does not require, the use of improved transceivers.

   The Standard discusses single CAN segments, and is silent on interconnecting multiple segments. For more
   discussion of options for interconnection, see the “Repeaters, Bridges and Gateways” section below.

2.2 References and Context

   Conformance testing is simplified when it can be done by referring to vendor documentation, rather than
   requiring specific tests of parameters. The Standard therefore refers to other existing standards, where
   possible, instead of repeating the information.

2.3 Physical Interconnection

   The Standard envisions two basic kinds of nodes: A board with 2 connectors and a box with a pig-tail
   cable, e.g. a handheld throttle. At the same time, the Standard should not rule out other
   implementations such as a board with two connectors and three pig-tails for attaching throttles, hence
   the somewhat complex wording in this section.

   The Standard permits providing a terminal block for an alternate wiring of the CAN bus, for example to
   reduce the cost of small networks, so long as an RJ45 connector or connectors is provided for
   Standard-compliant wiring. For example, a manufacturer using a terminal block or blocks would provide an
   adapter board with the two RJ45s which will fit into the terminal block to make a Standard-conforming
   product. This adapter board may have provision for a termination resistors circuit. For mechanical
   simplicity, a pluggable terminal block could be used to connect the adapter board. As a by-product, if a
   pluggable RJ45 adapter were used, it would allow the module to be removed without any disturbance to the
   CAN segment and no need to link the two floating ends of the cable.

   The signal names refer back to the signal definitions in the CAN specifications. UTP is unshielded
   cable, so the CAN_SHIELD conductor is being used as a second conductor for the CAN ground reference,
   CAN_GND.

   The conductor assignments are based on industry practice for RJ45 connectors on CAN networks, c.f.
   Recommendation CiA 303 (2009) of the CAN in Automation e.V. group.

   High-quality RJ45 connections are reliable even after thousands of connections and disconnections. (c.f.
   An HP survey of RJ45 use as a strain guage connector, a much more demanding application than this one:
   http://www.vtiinstruments.com/Catalog/Technotes/RJ-45_Excels_For_Stria_Gage_Connection.pdf) It's
   recommended that manufacturers use high-quality RJ45 jacks. They should also recommend that customers
   assemble CAN segments using high-quality RJ45 cables and plugs. In particular, cables with strain-relief
   boots and tab protectors will reduce connection problems for e.g. modular layouts.

   The assignments of particular wire colors are for information only. These are the wire colors that users
   will encounter in the two popular ways of wiring commercial cables. When building a product using
   commercial cable, using one of these two color assignments will reduce confusion, but most OpenLCB CAN
   users will never need to refer to the wire colors in their cables.

   The Standard does not require that all eight conductors be present in cables, but only the four that are
   minimally necessary for CAN communications. The reserved and power conductors are optional. This is
   because some low-cost CAT-3 “Ethernet” cables have only those required pairs present. Model railroaders
   who want to minimize cost, do not need distributed power, and are willing to forego future use of the
   reserved conductors can use these four-conductor CAT-3 “Ethernet” cables between nodes.

   The discussion of connecting in parallel is to make sure that all 8 wires go through a board, whether
   it's got connectors, pig-tail cables or a combination of the two, so long as it's got more than one
   connection to other nodes.

   The requirement to have all eight conductors present in nodes is so users can add power later, or an
   updated Standard can define the reserved conductors later, and still use them. The 1A requirement on
   interconnects is to make sure they're at least as robust as the connectors and cable.

   For information on sizing circuit board traces to carry the required interconnection current, please see
   “IPC-2152 — Specification for Determining Current-carrying Capacity in Printed Board Design, 2009.”

   All 8 wires don't have to go through the board if there's only one connection, e.g. a throttle with a
   single jack or pig-tail cable with plug. In that case, only two pairs are required.

   If a conforming device is providing power and has e.g. two jacks, the device can either connect them
   together and provide a max of 0.5A to both combined, or separately power them up to 0.5A each. This is
   the only case where a conductor doesn't have to pass through the board as a continuous electrical
   circuit. Note that this means that the device has to provide power, however; if providing power is an
   option, not always present, the device should connect conductor 8 across the board to ensure that
   downstream nodes aren't cut off from power when it's not provided by the device.

   Note that the Standard permits, but does not require, connecting the CAN signal ground on conductors 3 &
   6 with the PWR_NEG power distribution ground on conductor 7. Power-supplying and power-consuming boards
   can connect PWR_NEG and the 3/6 grounds to simplify their internal structure. Designers should carefully
   consider noise immunity, the possibility of ground loops, and voltage offsets when doing this. A
   straight copper connection is within the letter of the requirement. An alternative to connecting them
   directly is a filtered connection, e.g. a 10 ohm resistor and a small RF choke or ferrite bead choke to
   isolate high frequency energy on the ground path.

   Nodes that need a connection between conductor 7 and conductors 3 & 6 for proper operation are required
   to connect those conductors to avoid situations where the necessary connection is made on some other
   node, because that results in hard-to-diagnose bugs as the other node is connected and disconnected.
   It's also meant to avoid situations where the remote ground connection results in large ground currents
   and/or reduced noise margin.

   The 100V requirement on the reserved conductors is there to make sure that when a use is defined for
   them later, it doesn't blow up existing installations. The goal is to have all existing installations be
   able to move to newly-defined uses without having to retrofit cables nor non-involved nodes.

   To use the reserved conductors for experimental purposes, consider using jumpers (fixed or movable) for
   making connections to the conductors and/or splitting the reserved conductors between connectors so that
   the user can restore normal usage later, should some other use be defined for the reserved conductors.

   One use of the reserved conductors would be to carry a DCC signal for synchronization or other purposes.
   This could be as an NMRA RP 9.1.2 signal or some other format. Note that the DCC signal has 1-bits that
   are 58 (nominal, min 55, max 61) microseconds long. The DCC signal has a 7th harmonic 8.28 (nominal, min
   7.86, max 8.71) microseconds long, close to the CAN bit time of 8.00 microseconds. A true square wave
   will have a 7th harmonic amplitude equal to 4/(7pi) the amplitude of the square wave. For a DCC power
   signal this may be as large as 5 volts. The DCC track signal (NMRA S 9.1) is specified to have a slew
   rate at the origin of 2.5V/microsecond or larger. When putting DCC on the OpenLCB CAN cable, the
   designer may want to consider ensuring balanced transmission, or reducing the amplitude or slew-rate of
   the DCC replica signal to reduce noise coupling into the CAN signal. (NMRA S 9.1 requires decoders to be
   largely immune to noise above 100kHz, which includes the CAN signal).

   The 27V value in the no-damage requirement for the power connection comes from the S9.1 limitation on
   track voltage. In the unlikely case that a OpenLCB CAN RJ45 connector is plugged into a telephone
   system, a ringing telephone line can provide as much as 100 volts.

   Note that the ISO 11898-2 CAN specification for maximum rating of CAN drivers is -3.0, +16.0 or +32.0
   volts. Some CAN transceiver parts have higher maximum input voltage ratings. Implementors should check
   the specifications of their selected CAN transceivers, and consider whether additional protection
   against over-voltage damage might be worthwhile if the maximum rating of the component is less than the
   maximum DCC track voltage.

2.4 Data Transport

   A reduced slew rate is preferred to reduce the effect of stubs on the network (c.f. the calculation in
   section 4.8 of TI SLLA 270 http://focus.ti.com/lit/an/slla270/slla270.pdf) It's expected that model
   railroad networks will eventually use stubs to e.g. connect to handheld devices, so it's important to
   build support for a reasonable number of stubs into the network specification from the start. Note that
   many off-the-shelf CAN transceiver parts have slew rates greater than 10V/microsecond by default. The
   recommended value for the slew rate is 4V/microsecond. A design range of 10V/microsecond to
   3.5V/microsecond lower limit would allow some manufacturing margin below the 4V/microsecond
   recommendation.

   The Standard only requires that termination meet the CAN requirements, which are limited to the
   differential total resistance of the terminators. Industry uses some improved termination practices
   which are discussed in the “Bus Termination” section below.

   The Standard is silent on the use of specific CAN frame formats or features.

2.5 Supply of Power

   The power supply section is meant to define a 12V nominal system with wide margins on production and
   consumption of power over the UTP cable. The Standard is written to allow nodes to use this power in a
   range of ways, including having local power regulation ranging from simple analog regulators through
   more advanced supplies that increase current and/or voltage. 12V was chosen to reduce heat loads when
   using the simplest regulators. The current limit was required by use of one conductor in UTP wiring and
   connectors.

   The power provisions are for low-power uses that can be conveniently handled over short lengths of
   cable. Boards are welcome to have other connectors for power. These other connectors can be anything not
   otherwise forbidden by some other standard, including terminal blocks, 2.1mm jacks, Anderson PowerPole
   connectors, or whatever else is considered useful for the specific market.

   In order to prevent excessive voltage drop in the network cable, any node that draws power from the
   network cable should not be located any further than 6m (20') of network cable length from a power
   supply point with sufficient capacity to power all the nodes located within that section of the network
   cable. In no case shall the total current flowing in any section of the network cable be allowed to
   exceed 1A. The specified maximum supply from any one connector of 500mA is meant to ensure this even in
   the presence of stub cables forming a T connection.

   The requirement that “If the node does not provide power on pin 8 on all connectors, pin 8 on all
   connectors shall be connected in parallel” is intended to allow a power-providing node to either have
   power supplied in parallel to all connectors, or via separate supplies to each connector. For example, a
   node could have a 500mA supply on a common conductor between two CAN connectors, or two 500mA supplies
   separately connected to two CAN connectors. A power-providing node is required to provide power to all
   connectors to reduce user confusion.

   Nodes must be marked with their capacity to supply current and/or their current requirements in order to
   make the power calculation simple and reliable: Just add up the numbers on the labels. The requirement
   that the label is always present, even when zero, is to reduce user frustration when they can't find a
   label. Simple icons may be used, such as:

   Power can be injected into the cable by simple “mid-span injector” devices, essentially just two RJ45
   connectors and a 2.1mm jack for a wall-wart. It is not required that power comes from a full node
   implementation.

   The wiring system is likely to result in power-supplying nodes being connected to each other. This is
   covered by the “shall withstand” voltage requirement: power supply boards must be able to be connected
   to each other, even if their output voltages are not exactly the same. One way to implement this is an
   isolating diode on the PWR_POS output. The closer the supply outputs are to the 12V nominal value, the
   better this will work.

2.6 Consumption of Power

   The labeling provision is to make the calculation of total power required simple and reliable: Just add
   up the numbers on the labels. The requirement that the label is always present, even when zero, is to
   reduce user frustration when they can't find a label.

   For their thermal calculations, node designers should assume that power is supplied at 15V.

   For their power calculations, node designers should assume that power is supplied at 7.5V.

                                               3 Design Issues

   This section contains discussion of issues that a designer may wish to consider when designing an
   OpenLCB CAN product. Nothing in this section is normative.

3.1 Bus Termination

   The CAN specification (ISO11898-2 section 7.1 and section 7.5.2) specifies the use of a bus termination
   resistor at each end of the bus of 120 (nominal; minimum 100, maximum 130) ohms and rated for 220mW or
   more. Several alternate termination schemes have been proposed in the literature, and these alternatives
   are discussed below.   

   Although the CAN specification allows the termination resistance to be below 120 ohms, this requires
   additional drive from the CAN transceivers. Holding the termination resistance closer to 120 ohms can
   allow a larger number of nodes on a CAN segment, but generally does not increase the maximum segment
   length.

  3.1.1 Termination Circuits

    3.1.1.1 Passive single resistor

   A single 120±10 ohm resistor of ¼ watt or more capacity can connected between CAN-H and CAN-L. This
   approach has the advantage of simplicity.

    3.1.1.2 Passive split resistors bypassed to ground

   This consists of the CAN-L and CAN-H lines being connected by two 60 ohm resistors in series, with their
   common connected via a capacitor to ground. This provides a bypass to ground for common mode noise. The
   tolerance on the individual resistor values is significantly tighter than on their total resistance.
   Several references recommend 1% tolerance resistors to reduce coupling of the differential CAN signal
   into common mode noise (http://focus.ti.com/lit/an/slla270/slla270.pdf)
   (http://focus.ti.com.cn/cn/lit/an/sloa101a/sloa101a.pdf). Selecting matched pairs of resistors with
   looser nominal tolerance might be another solution.

    3.1.1.3 Biased split termination

   As in (3.1.1.2), but the common of the resistors is also tied to a fixed voltage. This can be to nominal
   2.5V via a voltage divider (http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/00228a.pdf), or by using a
   voltage reference (http://focus.ti.com.cn/cn/lit/an/sloa101a/sloa101a.pdf)
   (http://www.nxp.com/documents/application_note/AN10211.pdf). If there is a significant offset of ground
   between two nodes, then this offset will be transmitted to the CAN lines with consequent degradation of
   common-mode rejection.

    3.1.1.4 Active termination

   This termination is accomplished by using active elements, such as transistors or op-amps, to  actively
   drive the bus to its proper state. Because of the recessive component of the ISO 11898-2 CAN signal,
   this form of termination is not appropriate.

    3.1.1.5 Distributed termination

   This technique requires a fixed number of custom-impedance nodes, and is therefore not suitable for
   model railroad applications that are based on user-specific ad-hoc networks made from standard
   components.

  3.1.2 Terminator Placement

   Termination can be supplied as an on-board option, or as a terminator housed within an RJ45 plug, or as
   a separate terminator device, depending on the preferences of the manufacturer and users.

   Using plug-resident terminators would seem to provide the maximum flexibility, but it may be difficult
   to build a split terminator into a RJ45 plug.

   If on-board terminators are provided, the Standard requires it be possible to enable or disable them
   depending on where the node is installed on the CAN segment. Termination should only occur at the two
   distant ends of the bus. Termination in the middle of a significant-length CAN bus is very disruptive
   because it causes reflections. The one downside to on-board termination is that it makes it much easier
   to have multiple terminators (customers think more must be good, and mistakenly turn them all on). It's
   required that nodes be shipped with on-board terminators disabled to reduce the chance that a
   termination load will be attached in the middle of the segment. Note that ISO11898-2 states “The
   locating of the termination within a CAN node should be avoided because the bus lines lose termination
   if this node is disconnected from the bus line.” (Section 5.2.1) and “It is not recommended to integrate
   the termination into a CAN node.” (Section 7.1)

   Manufacturers may want to provide a special termination node to provide some  indication of bus health
   as well as providing termination.  Industrial diagnostic equipment provides some examples of what can be
   done. (http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1406&dDocName=en546534)

3.2 EMC Management and Noise Immunity

   Electro-Magnetic Compatibility (EMC) refers to ensuring that a system, e.g. a CAN bus, does not cause
   interference with other systems. CAN is a robust signaling method developed for use in the difficult
   environment of automobiles. Issues of EMC, noise immunity, etc have been discussed in numerous vendor
   application notes including, but not limited to:

   http://www.nxp.com/documents/application_note/AN10211.pdf

   http://focus.ti.com/lit/an/slla270/slla270.pdf

   See also the “References” section below.

  3.2.1 Chokes

   A series choke or transformer can improve the noise immunity of a CAN transceiver. The Standard permits
   the use of one, but doesn't require it. The advantages and disadvantages of including one are discussed
   in the NXP (Philips) and Texas Instruments application notes referenced above. See also:

   http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slla271/slla271.pdf

   Typical parts are the TDK ZJYS81RS-2PL51(T)-G01 and the ZJYS51-2PT.

  3.2.2 ESD and surge protection

   The CAN Standard requires a certain level of over-voltage protection in CAN transceivers. External parts
   may be used to provide additional protection. The Standard is silent on this, requiring nothing beyond
   the CAN Standard, and OpenLCB makes no recommendations. Manufacturers may want to consider including
   additional protection, but have to balance the costs and benefits of that. For a longer discussion, see:

   J. Lepkowski and B. Wolfe, ON Semiconductor: EMI/ESD protection solutions for the CAN bus; CAN in
   Automation, iCC 2005
   www.can-cia.org/fileadmin/cia/files/icc/10/cia_paper_lepkowski.pdf

   For an example of external protection, see:

3.3 Sample Schematic

   The following informative schematic is a sample of various possible design choices, and not normative in
   any way.

                                      4 Repeaters, Bridges and Gateways

   A CAN segment is a set of directly-connected cables that is shared by multiple nodes with
   directly-connected transceivers. Any node on the segment can communicate with any other node. A CAN
   segment has limited length, number of nodes and stub connections due to timing and electrical properties
   of the cables and transceivers.

   Repeaters, bridges and gateways are different methods of connecting two or more CAN segments so that a
   node on one segment can communicate with nodes on any connected segment. This section provides some
   background information on these three alternatives. Note that the terminology is somewhat flexible, and
   not all manufacturers will refer to their products in the same way.

   In each section, URLs are provided for a few example devices. Inclusion of a device in this section is
   informational, and does not a imply a recommendation, positive or negative, for the device. No
   inferences should be drawn from a device being or not being included in this section.

4.1 Repeaters

   The number of nodes connected to a short CAN segment may be limited by the electrical drive
   characteristics of the transceivers for the CAN signal, without reaching the timing limitations of the
   CAN protocol. In this case, a repeater may be used to connect a second segment containing more nodes.
   The repeater effectively boosts the electrical signals moving from one segment to the other, so that the
   nodes on one side appear as only a single electrical load on the other.

   Doing this takes a small amount of time, so use of repeaters reduces the total possible end-to-end
   length of the combined CAN segments, typically reducing it by around 30 m / 100 ft per repeater. Under
   certain circumstances, they can be used to add long stubs to a CAN network; doing this successfully
   requires detailed understanding of CAN characteristics.

   Repeaters are sometimes referred to as “working at the bit level”. The CAN transmission is delayed by
   less than a bit time, and the CAN arbitration process still works between nodes on the two segments.

   http://www.ixxat.com/can_cr200_en.html

4.2 Bridges

   A bridge looks like an independent CAN node on each of two or more CAN segments, receiving frames on a
   segment and sending them independently on the others. As such, it allows connection of two or more full
   size, full node-count CAN segments.

   Bridges are sometimes referred to as “working at the frame level”. The CAN transmission is delayed by
   much more than a bit time, usually a frame time or longer.

   The CAN arbitration process takes place on each segment independently, and is not shared between the
   separate segments; frames will appear in different order on the various segments. RTR frames generally
   cannot be used across bridges.The protocol(s) running on the CAN segments must be compatible with these
   constraints if bridges are to be used.

   Because bridges break the timing connection between the connected segments, they can also be used for
   remote connections via non-CAN cables, wireless, etc. In this case, a bridge device is usually used at
   each end of the remote link, and the protocol between the two devices is specific to the CAN bridge
   function.

4.3 Gateways

   Gateways connect a CAN segment to another communication technology, such as IP over wireless, Ethernet
   or some other. In the process, they may reformat or translate the CAN frames as needed. For example, a
   USB-CAN adapter may convert the CAN frame bytes into some form of human-readable text.

   This reformatting may be independent of the CAN frame content information, or specific to some protocol
   that defines meaning for the CAN frames.

   This section provides references, and when possible URLs, that may be of use to OpenLCB-CAN
   implementors.

5.1 Standards

   The OpenLCB CAN Physical Layer Standard references ISO 11898-1 and ISO 11898-2 for CAN specifications.
   The ISO (http://www.iso.org) sells PDF and paper copies of these. Copies can generally be found in
   engineering libraries.
   (http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33422)
   (http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33423)

   Note that ISO 11898-3, 11898-4 and 11898-5 specify different variants of the CAN standard that are not
   relevant to OpenLCB CAN-compliant implementations. The original 1995 Bosch CAN standard, which can be
   found online, is similar to ISO 11898-1 and -2, but not identical.

   The OpenLCB CAN Physical Layer Standard references TIA/EIA-568-B or the successor TIA/EIA- 568-C for
   unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable, and TIA-968-A for RJ45 modular plugs and jacks. The TIA
   (http://www.tiaonline.org) sells PDF and paper copies of these. Copies can generally be found in
   engineering libraries.

5.2 Books

   This section is an informal list of books that may or may not be useful for people building OpenLCB CAN
   devices. The brief reviews are just opinion, and you should make up your own mind about the correctness
   and usefulness of the book.

  5.2.1 Recommended

   “Controller Area Network: Basics, Protocols, Chips and Applications”, Prof. Dr.-Ing. K. Etschberger,
   IXXAT Press, Weingarten, Germany 2001 – a little dated now, but has excellent discussions of theory,
   particularly for complex networks.

   "Embedded Networking with CAN and CANopen", Pfeiffer, Ayre and Keydel, Copperhill Technologies, 2008 –
   generally considered the gold standard in CAN books.

   “A Comprehensible Guide to Controller Area Network”, Wilfried Voss, Copperhill Technologies, 2005

   “Multiplexed Networks for Embedded Systems”, Dominique Paret, Wiley, 2007 – good coverage of CAN through
   first half of volume, including protocol and physical layer issues.

  5.2.2 Not Recommended

   “Designing Embedded Systems with PIC Microcontrollers”, Tim Wilmhurst, Newnes (Elsevier), 2010 – very
   brief coverage of CAN issues on pages 581 through 586.

   “Embedded Systems Design and Applications with the 68HC12 and HCS12”, S.F. Barret and D.J. Pack, Pearson
   Prentice Hall, 2005 – limited coverage of CAN from pages 595 through 600, with coverage of the details
   of the specific msCAN12 controller through page 634. Of limited value unless one is writing a low-level
   library for that controller.

5.3 Application Notes

   A number of component manufacturers have written application notes that may be useful to OpenLCB CAN
   developers. A list is provided here for reference, but note that none of these are normative; for
