                                                1 Introduction

   This Technical Note contains informative discussion and background for the corresponding OpenLCB Event
   Transport Standard. This explanation is not normative in any way.

   OpenLCB nodes respond to local inputs and state changes by emitting Producer/Consumer Event Report
   (PCER) messages. When they do this, they are acting as “Producers”. OpenLCB nodes receive these
   messages, and can act on them locally if desired. If they do so, they are acting as “Consumers”.
   Together, this is called the Producer-Consumer Model of system control. In this model a particular
   concept, or event, is the sum of the inputs that trigger the production of the PCER by the producer(s)
   and the action(s) taken by the consumer(s).

   Its main advantage is the knowledge independence it imparts between all of the nodes involved in an
   event. Expressed in more anthropomorphic terms, neither the producers nor consumers of a PCER are aware
   of each other. This adds flexibility to the system, since more producers or consumers of the PCER can be
   added to implement the associated event, without concern of side effects to the other nodes involved in
   the event.^1^,^2

   The Producer/Consumer Event ID included in a PCER message is an 8-byte unique identifier. The method for
   assigning these and ensuring their uniqueness is in the OpenLCB Event Identifiers Standard and Technical
   Note.

   There are many possible ways to use these 64 bits, some of which are discussed as examples below. In
   particular, OpenLCB does not require or enforce any particular partitioning of the eight bytes. More
   than one node may emit the same Producer/Consumer Event ID (note that the Node ID of the emitting node
   is available separately in the message). More than one node may receive and act on a PCER message with a
   specific Producer/Consumer Event ID. The only requirement is that the 8-byte quantity be unique to the
   event.

   OpenLCB event IDs carry no specific information about whether they are coding “on” or “off”, “active” or
   “inactive” for some output state. It's possible for multiple consumers to do different things in
   response to a single event: A event that means “set nighttime lighting” might turn some outputs off and
   turn others on. Simple nodes will often use two producers to represent “input line N went on” and “input
   line N went off”; they will often use two consumers to represent “turn on output line N” and “turn off
   output line N”.

   OpenLCB events therefore do not directly represent states. Rather, they represent state transitions, or
   rather a change to the state of the layout. One event might be interpreted as “go to output N on”,
   another as “go to output N off”, and only by seeing which transition happened most recently can the
   state of output N be recovered.

                                        2 Annotations to the Standard

   This section provides background information on corresponding sections of the Standard document. It is
   expected that these two documents will be read together.

2.1 Introduction

   Nothing to add to the Standard.

2.2 Intended Use

   A particular PCER may be produced in response to physical input or state change on a layout, for example
   a contact closure or the activation of a block occupancy detector, or it can be in response to a
   non-physical change such as the arrival of a certain time. The same PCER can be produced by several
   different state changes. That PCER may result in some action at consumers. The term 'event' includes the
   state changes, the PCER message, and the resulting actions, and represent a specific idea or concept,
   such as “Night has fallen”.

   For example, the concept of an “Emergency stop” event might include the actions of turning off track
   power, turning on a fault-indicator, and sounding a buzzer. The PCER may be produced by any of: a panic
   button, a throttle button, an over-current detector, or an anti-collision system.

   The aforementioned “Night has fallen” event might be triggered by a fast-clock time, a toggle switch, or
   a control program, and its actions might include illuminating street lights, house lights, and the
   dimming of overhead lighting.

   In addition, ranges of PCERs can be used for specific purposes. For example, a fast clock's messages can
   be implemented as a range of PCERs, where the low order bytes code the time.

2.3 References and Context

    For more information on format and presentation, see:

     * OpenLCB Common Information Technical Note

   For more information on MTI values and how they are laid out, see:

     * OpenLCB Message Network Standard

     * OpenLCB MTI allocation table^3.

2.4 Message Formats

   The range mask is implemented as a combined base value and mask in order to save space. The base value
   takes the form 0bv...0 and the mask 0b0...m. If the lowest bit of the base value is a one, then the
   combined form is 0bv...0. However, if the lowest bit of the base value is a zero, then the mask is
   inverted and the combined form becomes 0bv...1.

   Ranges can only be specified in powers of 2, i.e., they can specify ranges of 2, 4, 8, … .Therefore, if
   a range of n is required, then the next larger power of two is used. Ranges should not be over
   specified, so the standard requires that a range not extend past the next power of two by requiring that
   at least 50% of the EventIDs in the range be relevant.

   Encoding a range is done by determining how many values are required, choosing the next higher power of
   two, choosing a base value and the mask, and finally combining the two, inverting the mask if necessary.
   For example, a range 0x1234xx would require a mask of the form 0x0000FF, and the combined form would be
   0x1234FF. A range of 0x1235xx would also require a mask of 0x0000FF, but the combined form would be
   0x123500, since the mask is inverted. In this example, an event range of 256 events and a 16-bit address
   is specified.

   Decoding a range involves identifying the mask as lowest contiguous bits of the same value as the lowest
   bit. The base value is the remaining high order bits. For example, the combined form 0x987650 would
   yield a mask of 0x00000F (inverted) and a base of 0x98765, whereas 0x98764F would yield a mask of
   0x00000F and a base of 0x987640. In this example, an event range of 16 events and a 20-bit address is
   specified.

  2.4.1 Producer/Consumer Event Report (PCER)

   This message transports an Event ID from a producer node(s) to zero or more unspecified consumer nodes.
   It is the backbone of the protocol, and forms most of the expected traffic.

   The source Node ID allows identification of which node sent the event. This can be used for diagnostic
   and status purposes, but nodes must act on the event without regard to where it came from.

  2.4.2 Identify Consumer

   This message is broadcast and requests each node to report whether it consumes this Event ID.

  2.4.3 Consumer Identified

   This message is broadcast, in response to a received Identify Consumer message, from each node that
   consumes the included Event ID. Nodes also send this as part of their startup so that other nodes know
   they want to consume particular events.

   This is one of the messages that allows bridges to do automatic routing of event messages.

   The “valid”, “invalid”, “unknown” subforms are used to attempt to recover the state of the overall
   system. In general, event transmission via PCER messages conveys state changes. If a node comes in
   during operation, it might want to determine the correct value of the distributed state. Producers can,
   but don't always, know that state. For example, consider “On” and “Off” events for a light. There might
   be two producers attached to a toggle switch. In that case, one of them will still see their state as
   current, and will reply with valid. Alternately, the two producers might be set to produce when two
   separate pushbuttons are pressed. In that case, at some later time neither producer knows whether the
   distributed state corresponds to its event. They both have to report as unknown. Consumers can also know
   the state. The lamp controller that consumes the “On” and “Off” probably knows whether it is currently
   providing power to the lamp, and so can reply with valid for one event and invalid for the other.

  2.4.4 Consumer Range Identified

   This message broadcasts, in response to a received Identify Consumer message, from each node that
   consumes events in the range specified by the included event-ID-with-mask. This is one of the messages
   that allows bridges to do automatic routing of event messages.

   The requirement that 50% or more of the Event IDs in a range are consumed is to allow rounding the range
   up to the enclosing bit, but no further. This keeps the Event ID ranges in the complete OpenLCB system
   compact and is intended to make the task of gateways more manageable.

   Allowing this requirement to be overridden by other Standards permits development of standard protocols
   that use one Consumer Range Identified message for separate disconnected ranges to improve efficiency.
   By only allowing this to be done via the Standards process, not as an ad-hoc design issue, complexity is
   kept under control.

  2.4.5 Identify Producer

   This message is broadcast and requests each node to report whether it produces this Event ID.

  2.4.6 Producer Identified

   This message is broadcast, in response to a received Identify Producer message, from each node that
   produces the included Event ID. This is one of the messages that allows bridges to do automatic routing
   of event messages.

   The ProducerIdentified message is different from a Producer-ConsumerEventReport message for several
   reasons:

     * It allows the valid/invalid/unknown subforms, which don't make any sense for a PCER message

     * It allows network listeners to separate the event identification mechanism, which uses
       ProducerIdentified, from the event transport mechanism, which uses PCER. Otherwise, nodes might
       think that an event had occurred and was being produced, when it was just a response to a request
       for current status.

  2.4.7 Producer Range Identified

   The requirement that 50% or more of the Event IDs in a range are produced is to allow rounding the range
   up to the enclosing bit, but no further. This keeps the Event ID ranges in the complete OpenLCB system
   compact and is intended to make the task of gateways more manageable.

   Allowing this requirement to be overridden by other Standards permits development of standard protocols
   that use one Producer Range Identified message for separate disconnected ranges to improve efficiency.
   By only allowing this to be done via the Standards process, not as an ad-hoc design issue, complexity is
   kept under control.

   An example of a producer range would be a fast clock node that sends a range of events to indicate the
   time. Since there are 24*60*60 = 86,400 seconds in a day, it needs a range containing 86,400 events. In
   this case, rather than having to send 86,400 individual ProducerIdentified messages at start-up or on
   request, it can send one Producer Range Identified message with the appropriate base/mask Event ID Range
   value.

   This message is broadcast, in response to a received Identify Producer message, from each node that
   produces events in the range specified by the included event-ID-with-mask. This is one of the messages
   that allows bridges to do automatic routing of event messages.

  2.4.8 Identify Events

   Identify Events comes in both addressed and global forms. They are intended to be used for different use
   cases.

   In some cases, the node may want to query a specific node as to what events it produces or consumes. In
   these cases the directed form is appropriate. This message will minimize the load on the network as only
   the node of interest will respond.

   In other cases, the node producing the Identify Events message has a lack of knowledge to which nodes
   produce or consume the events of interest, and therefore the global form is the more appropriate choice.
   The global form of Identify Events is similar to the combination of an Identify Producers and an
   Identify Consumers message for every possible enumeration of Event Ids. This event is useful to build
   routing tables for networks segments or network browsing tool but be aware that since this form is
   transmitted throughout the network, it can be relatively expensive in terms of bandwidth.

  2.4.9 Learn Event

   This message is part of a communication-based method for configuring various producers and consumers
   across the OpenLCB network to respond to a single Event ID. After those producers and consumers have
   been selected via some other process, this message is broadcast to carry a specific Event ID to all of
   them.

2.5 States

   After the Initialization Complete message is sent, but before any Producer/Consumer Event Report
   messages are sent, each node must identify all events produced or consumed via zero or more Identify
   Consumer, Identify Consumer Range, Identify Producer and Identify Producer Range messages. These are not
   required to be in any particular order.

2.6 Interactions

   Nothing prevents extra Producer/Consumer Identified messages. Nothing prevents combining replies to
   multiple requests. This allows simplified implementations, for example setting a bit to indicate that a
   reply can be sent when time/priority is available.

   Nodes can send identify/identified messages for automatically-routed Event IDs. Nodes aren't required to
   reply to Identify Producer/Consumer messages for automatically-routed Event IDs to simplify node
   programming, but it is useful if they do.

   Identify Producer/Consumer messages for well-known Event IDs require response; there's no exemption for
   those.

   The state of the system can sometimes be constructed from the received Producer/Consumer Identified
   messages and their “valid”, “invalid”, “unknown” subforms. It is possible that these will result in
   conflicting and/or ambiguous state.

   Note that the Advertised/Not-Advertised state machine is reset by the Initialization Complete message,
   and not by any lower level link (CAN or other) state machine.

   Delay in sending the Producer Identified / Producer Range Identified and Consumer Identified / Consumer
   Range Identified messages after Initialization Complete is allowed, but there's no delivery guarantee
   for this node's events until those have been sent and the state has transitioned to Advertised.

   When a node changes the events it manages, it still needs to emit the Producer Identified / Producer
   Range Identified and/or Consumer Identified / Consumer Range Identified messages. For example,
   reconfiguration could cause this. It can be handled by sending individual messages, or by resetting and
   sending them all as part of that process.

   There is no way to indicate that a node is no longer interested in a particular Event ID. (Sending
   Initialization Complete again says that all events are not interesting, though). This could be added,
   but it is much harder for gateways to decide that an Event ID is not interesting than that it is
   interesting, because they have to keep a list of all the node IDs that are interested, and back that
   off. Better to just let the set of interesting Event IDs grow until the layout or gateway is reset.

   To ensure that event messages are properly routed, nodes must announce when they start to produce or
   consume messages. Specifically, they must do this at two times:

     * When the node is first initialized, after the “Initialization Complete” message has been sent.

     * When a configuration change has added another Event ID that can be produced or consumed.

   To announce new Event IDs, the node must transmit a Producer Identified message for each
   Producer/Consumer Event ID it can newly produce, and a Consumer Identified message for each
   Producer/Consumer Event ID that it can newly consume.

  2.6.1 Event Transfer

   The last sentence is the key to gateway traffic reduction. See §3.1 below.

  2.6.2 Event Inquiry

   Identify Events comes in both global and addressed forms. The global form can place a very large load on
   the network and should only be used when needed.

   The Identify Events message is sent to request that the specified nodes report all the events they
   produce or consume. These reports can be Identified Event messages specifying individual Event IDs or
   ranges of events.

   Identify Events is useful to be able to rapidly determine which, if any, Producer/Consumer Event IDs
   that a particular node is listening for and that it can emit. This can be used as a configuration
   diagnostic.

   To determine which Producer/Consumer Event IDs can be sent by a particular node, the inquiring node
   sends an Identify Events message addressed to the target node.

   The node must reply with a Producer Identified message for each Producer/Consumer Event ID it can
   produce, and a Consumer Identified message for each Producer/Consumer Event ID for which it is
   listening.

  2.6.3 Producer Inquiry

   It is useful to be able to determine which, if any, nodes are configured to possibly transmit a specific
   PCER message and the current state of those producers. This can be used as a configuration diagnostic,
   and as a way of building filtering and routing tables.

   To determine which nodes can send a particular Producer/Consumer Event ID, a node sends an Identify
   Producers message carrying the desired Producer/Consumer Event ID. This is an unaddressed message
   addressed to all nodes.

   All nodes that are listening for that Producer/Consumer Event ID reply with a Producer Identified
   broadcast message.

   The “valid” bit indicates that the node's internal condition is consistent with sending this
   Producer/Consumer Event ID. For example, assume a node sends Producer/Consumer Event ID 2 when the input
   goes active and Producer/Consumer Event ID 4 when the input goes inactive. Then if the input was active
   and the node was asked about Producer/Consumer Event ID 2, it would reply “valid”; if asked about
   Producer/Consumer Event ID 4, it would reply “not valid”. Depending on the node's structure, it might
   not always be possible to set the “valid” bit with certainty, in which case the “unknown” bit must be
   set.

   You can query a state when you come up with the Identify Events message. Conflicting states can happen,
   and have to be addressed. You might also want to enquire of the consumers if you don't get a definitive
   answer from the producers.

   In regard to valid/invalid/unknown, it is always possible to send only unknown, or to ignore the three
   sub-forms, but a lot of capability is then lost.

  2.6.4 Consumer Inquiry

   This message is useful to determine which, if any, nodes are listening for a specific Producer/Consumer
   Event ID message.

   This can be used as a configuration diagnostic, and as a way of building routing tables.

   To determine which nodes are listening for a particular Producer/Consumer Event ID, a node sends an
   Identify Consumers message carrying the desired Producer/Consumer Event ID. This is an unaddressed
   message processed by all nodes.

   All nodes that are listening for that Producer/Consumer Event ID reply with a Consumer Identified
   broadcast message.

   The “valid” bit indicates that the node is currently in the state it would be if this message had been
   received last. For example, assume a node sets its output active for Producer/Consumer Event ID 2, and
   inactive for a Producer/Consumer Event ID 4. Then if the output was active and the node was asked about
   Producer/Consumer Event ID 2, it would reply "valid"; if asked about Producer/Consumer Event ID 4, it
   would reply "not valid". Depending on the node's structure, it might not always be possible to set the
   “valid” bit with certainty, in which case the “unknown” bit must be set.

  2.6.5 Teach/Learn Configuration

   Entry-level OpenLCB users should be able to buy two OpenLCB nodes and configure them to do something
   useful with only the pushbutton(s) and LED(s) on them, without requiring a separate configuration tool,
   computer, etc.

   Producers (in nodes that connect to buttons, toggle switches, occupancy detectors, etc) and consumers
   (in nodes connected to signals, LEDs, displays, layout lighting, etc) need to be configured to use a
   common EventID, such that activating a producer will send the common EventID, which will cause one or
   more consumers to activate.

   The Teach/Learn Configuration interaction provides communications support for that. It works without any
   central configuration mechanism, nor even any global knowledge of which producers and consumers are
   being configured.

   The configuration starts by using external mechanisms, e.g. walking around and pushing buttons, to
   select producers and consumers which will learn the common EventID. These are colloquially called
   "Learners". The Standard does not discuss how a node defines its local user interface for doing that
   selection process^4. A single producer or consumer then provides the EventID that is to be learned in a
   “Teach Event” message. If the taught Event ID is a new unique ID, then only the selected producers and
   consumers will share it. If producers and/or consumers are already using that Event ID, the newly
   configured producers and/or consumers will be tied into the existing network of producers and consumers.

    2.6.5.1 Blue/Gold Buttons Implementation Example

   General Description

   Nodes can be built with two buttons, called Blue and Gold, which can be used to configure the nodes'
   hardware, including event IDs from one node to one or more other nodes.

     * On one or more 'learner'-node(s), using the Blue-button, choose a consumer/producer, and then push
       the Gold-button to set it to learn. This can be repeated on the same node or on others.

     * On the 'teacher'-node, push the Gold-button to choose teach-mode, then using the Blue-button, choose
       a consumer/producer.

     * Push the Gold-button to send the Learn Event message.

     * As a result, all producers selected above will activate all the consumers.

   Summary:

     * Select to learn: blue, blue, ..., gold.

     * Select to teach: gold, blue, blue, …, gold.

   Notes:

     * Pushing the Blue-button selects consumer/producer's in a circular fashion, with a 'no-selection'
       before starting again at the beginning

     * The teaching- producer/consumer can also be a 'learner'.

     * New teaching will replace the previous teaching.

     * Pushing Gold for more than 3-seconds will reset the node to its factory events.

   Layout Example

   Given two Button-nodes, each with three buttons, A-C and D-F, respectively, and four Signals-nodes, 1-4:

    1. Buttons set Aspects: Push blue on Signal-1 until the 'green' aspect is selected, then push gold. On
       the first Button-node, push gold, and then blue once to select button-A, then push the gold again.
       On Signal-1 use the blue-button to select aspect 'red', and push gold, and then on the Button-node
       push gold and the blue twice to select button-B, and then gold again. Now, pushing button-A will
       change Signal-1 to green, and button-B will change it to red.

    2. Make a duplicate button: On the second Button-node, push blue once to select button-D, and then
       gold, and on the first Button-node, push gold, then blue once and then gold. On the second
       Button-node, push blue twice to select button-E, and then gold, and on the first Button-node, push
       gold, then blue twice and then gold. Now, button-D will turn Signal-1 to green, and button-E will
       turn it to red.

    3. Add a second consumer-node: On Signal-2 push blue to select red and then gold, then on Signal-1 push
       gold, then blue to select green, and then gold. On Signal-2 push blue to select green and then gold,
       then on Signal-1 push gold, then blue to select red, and then gold. Now pushing button-A sets
       Signal-1 to green and signal-2 to red, and button-B turns Signal-1 to red and Signal-2 to green.

  2.6.6 Resetting to Default

   Nodes are responsible for ensuring that a Event ID is really unique if required. This has implications
   for how event IDs are defined when the node is reset to “factory defaults”.

   For example, say that a node has Node ID 1.2.3.4.5.6 and therefore starts with its first producer
   containing the 1.2.3.4.5.6.0.1 Event ID. As it comes from the factory, this Event ID is guaranteed to be
   unique because it comes from the node's unique ID.

   This Event ID can be then be configured into several other nodes, which are using it for some particular
   purpose, say “start of day”. The node 1.2.3.4.5.6 producer can then be reconfigured to contain some
   other event ID, say 6.5.4.3.2.1.99.99 which is used to mean “end of day”.

   If the node is reset to defaults and returns to 1.2.3.4.5.6.0.1, that's no longer a “unique” Event ID.
   It's being used by another part of the system for “start of day”. Node 1.2.3.4.5.6 will not be behaving
   as expected for a reset node, as it'll be responding to events taking place on the network. Further,
   it's 1.2.3.4.5.6.0.1 Event ID is not safe to be copied out into other producers and consumers.

   One way to do this is to maintain a counter of created unique Event IDs, and use the next set when doing
   a reset to defaults. There are 65,538 different Event IDs possible for a node, so even one that uses 512
   Event IDs can be reset to defaults a lot of times before its are risk of running out.

   Alternately, the node can keep track of which Event IDs might have left the node and been reused. This
   includes any of the messages that carry the Event ID, including but not limited to Teach Event, plus
   configuration memory reads and perhap other methods. If the Event ID in a producer or consumer has been
   retrieved and used, then it needs to be given a new Event ID. If not, it can keep it's existing Event
   ID. While Identify Event messages can be used to discover if a particualr Event is being used, it will
   not find any nodes that are not active, or have left the layout, so a conflict could occur if those
   nodes become active of the layout again. It is therefore much safer to reset to defaults and obtain a
   new set of unused Events. This is particularly important is the node is passed onto someone else.

2.7 CAN Adaptation

   For reference, we describe the messages defined in this standard as formatted for the CAN transport
   protocol. This section is not normative; should there be a conflict between this document and the
   Standards, then the Standards take precedence.

   The CAN Frame Transport Standard and Message Network Standard define how OpenLCB messages are carried
   across CAN networks. Following those standards, the Event Transport messages used on CAN are as defined
   in the following table.

                MessageName               Simple  Dest ID  Event ID      Header Format        Data-part

                                          3 Background information 

   This section is general information of interest to the reader, implementers, etc.

   An OpenLCB Event represents the sum of all the causes and actions associated with particular concept ,
   such as “Night is falling”, and implements a many-to-many relationship. It has been referred to as the
   Producer-Consumer Model, in opposition to the Master-Slave Model.^7  Each Event is abstracted into a
   single unique event-number. An Event-message contains only this event-number. An advantage of this model
   is that new triggers or new causes which cause the production of the event-number, or new actions
   resulting from the consumption the event-number, can be implemented by a node without reference to other
   producers or consumers, which makes this model very flexible and extensible.

   Events are most often used to advertise changes in system state, for example an occupancy detector's
   state. The model maintains the distributed-state model of a layout because Events-messages are
   broadcast^8 to all nodes, and this allows individual producers and consumers to use them to change their
   knowledge of the distributed state.

   Other important, and perhaps not obvious, uses include: publishing a capability using an event from a
   list of well-known Event IDs; transmitting well-known ranges of data, such as fast-clock time; and
   embedding an other system's message into the bytes of the Event ID, for example a DCC accessory message.
   Notice that these latter uses allows any node to respond to these messages using its usual
   event-handling. For example, a node can activate an output in response to a specific fast-clock time.

3.1 Gateways

   Gateways can route PCERs only to segments with nodes expressing interest by processing the other event
   messages, including Consumer and Producer Identified.

   The automatically-routed event range always has to be routed. This can be done by making a permanent
   entry in routing tables, or any other implementation method.

3.2 Examples

   Consider a OpenLCB installation with two CAN segments A and B connected via gateways and a TCP/IP link.
   In addition, a program is attached via a TCP/IP link and additional gateway to CAN segment B.

   Figure 1 – Example OpenLCB Network

   The program has to be able to fully communicate with all OpenLCB nodes on both segments A and B. These
   examples shows how the gateways can make that happen. For simplicity, the labels on the figure will be
   used as if they were the full NID of the node, e.g. "GB1" for the left gateway on segment B. Frames and
   messages are represented by [“source address”, “content”, “optional destination address”] triplets. Not
   all messages are shown. Note that there are many ways that gateways can manage traffic, and this is just
   one approach.

   Before the cases below, both segments come up, assign the numbers 1,2,3 as aliases to their local nodes,
   10 to gateway 1 and 20 to gateway 2 on segment B. For simplicity, A1 produces event X, which A2 and B2
   want to consume. A1 also produces Y, which no other node wants to consume.

  3.2.1 Case 1: All nodes initialized before link established, event X is sent

   The A-B gateways initialize their internal tables.

   A1 sends X. GA receives it. Because GA hasn't seen X before, X is forwarded across the link to GB,
   followed by an “Identify Consumers of X” message.

   GB puts the X message on the CAN segment, and B2 consumes it.

   GB puts the “Identify Consumers of X” message on the CAN segment.

   B2 responds with “Consumer of X Identified”

   GB receives “Consumer of X Identified”, forwards to GA, which marks its tables to continue forwarding
   these. GA forwards that message on the CAN segment in case there are other listeners for it.

  3.2.2 Case 2: Node B2 comes up, after event X has been sent in the example above

   The gateways are up, but don't know about B2. GA has seen X sent by A1, but has marked it as “do not
   forward” because there was no consumer for it on B.

   B2 comes up, gets a NID alias assigned, sends “AMD” and “Initialization Complete”.

   B2 sends “Consumer of X Identified”. GB forwards that to GA.

   GA remembers that event X must be forwarded across this link if seen.

   A1 sends X, GA receives it, forwards it across link.

  3.2.3 Case 3: Node A1 comes up, then event X is sent

   The gateways are up, but don't know about A1 or X.

   A1 comes up, gets a NID alias assigned, sends “AMD” and “Initialization Complete”.

   A1 sends “Producer of X Identified”. GA forwards that to GB.

   GA notes that event X currently must be forwarded across this link if/when seen.

   A1 sends X. GA receives it. Because GA hasn't seen X before, X is forwarded across the link to GB,
   followed by an “Identify Consumers of X” message.

   The rest of this proceeds like case 1.

  3.2.4 Case 4: Node A1 comes up, then event Y is sent

   The gateways are up, but don't know about A1 or Y.

   A1 comes up, gets a NID alias assigned, sends “AMD” and “Initialization Complete”.

   A1 sends “Producer of Y Identified”. GA forwards that to GB.

   GA notes that event Y currently must be forwarded across this link if seen.

   A1 sends X. GA receives it. Because GA hasn't seen Y before, Y is forwarded across the link to GB,
   followed by an “Identify Consumers of Y” message.

   No “Consumer of Y Identified” message is received back, so after a short timeout GA marks it's tables to
   not forward Y. (If a not later comes up that consumes Y, a sequence similar to Case 2 occurs.)

3.3 Node Implementation hints

   Buffering issues, particularly on CAN, have to be carefully considered. All nodes have to be able to
   keep up with PCER messages that can arrive about every millisecond (125000 bps / 120 bits per message)

     * Don't do long linear searches to match an incoming Event ID to internal structures.

     * Instead, consider just decoding the Event ID and setting a “process as available” bit, and then
       doing further work outside the CAN receive loop.

   There is no requirement that events be processed in any particular order. Multiple PCER messages with
   the same Event ID may result in multiple actions inside a consumer, or may not, depending on the details
   of the consumer. There's a whole range of ways that events could be handled. A consumer might always
   handle them in the order received, and with the inter-event time intervals as received, down to the
   microsecond. Or it might do them in-order on a time-available basis, and generally be able to do them in
   50 milliseconds. Or it might do them in the order that lets it get done fastest. Or whatever. Similar
   discussion goes for repeated events: Does the hardware have to do something twice? That depends. In some
   cases, it's not even clear what it means. Specifying this is the node manufacturers job, because they
   have uses in mind, and they make nodes to meet those uses. OpenLCB just arranges to deliver events for
   them their processing. Node manufacturers should certainly specify the performance of their nodes. More
   knowledge is good, but the standard doesn't compel anything because it's hard to write a testable
   requirement.

   The Standard doesn't make any statements about delivery performance because it's specific to the
   link-types, arrangement of OpenLCB nodes & links, etc that make up a specific OpenLCB network. In
   general, OpenLCB is going to provide sub-millisecond, millisecond, or perhaps even 10's of millisecond
   timing quality, for example. Nor can it guarantee absolute order of events. If Node A and Node B emit
   events at the same time on different segments, there's no guarantee of when node C will receive them,
   nor in what order, nor that Node D will receive it at the same time & in the same order as Node C.

3.4 Well known events

   There are a small number of cases where a globally-allocated and reserved Event ID will simplify
   operation. These “well-known Event ID numbers” can be used to e.g. advertise that a node can provide a
   specific capability, or to tell locomotive control hardware to stop all trains instantly, etc.

   For these to be useful, they not only have to be unique (so there are no collisions that accidentally
   trigger reactions to them), but they must also be well-known. All of these are assigned with the
   01.00.00.00.00.00 or 01.01.00.00.00.00 reserved IDs in their upper six bytes to ensure uniqueness and
   simplify recognition.  The OpenLCB group maintains a central list of the individual assigned Event
   IDs.^9

   The Event IDs that start 01.00.00.00.00.00 are the automatically-routed events, a subset of the
   well-known events.

   Except for the automatically-routed events, nodes producing or consuming well-known events must mention
   them when identifying the event IDs they produce and consume. Gateways may filter on these, but are not
   required to. For ease of implementation, a gateway may just pass all events with the common values of
   the top 6 bytes.

   8 OpenLCB uses interest-based routing, which means that Event messages are actually broadcast only to
   those bus segments on which a node has expressed interest. Event-ranges are used to express interest in
   a classes of events.
