                                                     Configuration Description Information

                                                   Feb 17, 2015                          Adopted            

                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This document defines a standard for the format of static information that describes the configuration
   options available on an OpenLCB node, called “Configuration Description Information (CDI)”.
   “Configuration Description Information” in this context refers to fixed information available from an
   OpenLCB device, via OpenLCB, so that other devices can properly and correctly configure it.

   This Standard does not address how the CDI is stored, retrieved, or used.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   CDI is intended to be used by a configurable, self-contained OpenLCB node to tell a Configuration Tool
   (CT) how to configure the node. The configuration tool will use the CDI information to help the user
   configure all aspects of the node's capabilities.

   The configurable values are expressed as Variables, with each Variable having a specific type, a size in
   bytes, a value for Space and Address (to locate the variable), and Name and Description as user-readable
   strings so that users understand the use of the particular setting.

   Variables can be grouped together, groups can be repeated (for example if a Node has multiple outputs)
   and nested to express complex configuration setups with concise description.

                                    3 References and Context (Informative)

   For more information on format and presentation, see:

     * OpenLCB Common Information Technical Note

   For information on OpenLCB message transport and OpenLCB communications, see:

     * OpenLCB Message Network Standard

   For information on how to fetch the CDI information from a node, and how to read and write the
   configuration information, see:

     * OpenLCB Memory Configuration Protocol Standard

   For information on XML encoding and XML Schema, see:

     * World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) “Extensible Markup Language (XML)”^1

     * World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) “XML Schema”^2

                                            4 Content (Normative)

   The configuration description information for a node is invariant while the node has any OpenLCB
   connections in the Initialized state.

   The CDI has three parts:

     * Identification: Provides specific information about the type of the node.

     * ACDI: Indicates that certain configuration information in the node has a standardized simplified
       format.

     * Segments: The configuration information in the node is organized in zero or more segments, each of
       which contains zero or more configurable variables. A variable is the basic unit of configuration.
       The segment definition specifies the organization of each segment. A segment consists of zero or
       more bytes within a linear address space.

                                             5 Format (Normative)

   The CDI is provided as a zero-terminated string of bytes. The bytes encode UTF-8 characters. There is no
   byte-order mark (BOM) at the start of the string. Lines in the string are delimited with 0x12 Newline
   (NL) characters.

   The content defines the configuration description information in XML 1.0 format using a specific XML
   vocabulary defined by an XML Schema. No extensions to XML 1.0 are permitted.

   This version of this Standard specifies version 1.1 of the schema. That version of the schema is defined
   at http://openlcb.org/schema/cdi/1/1/cdi.xsd and in Appendix A of this document. The CDI content shall
   pass validation against its  referenced schema. Nodes are not required to do the validation.

   The version number of an OpenLCB CDI schema contains two numbers: The major version first, and the minor
   version second.

   The first line of the CDI is:

   <?xml version="1.0"?>

   to define the XML version of the content.

   The root element of the CDI XML is:

   <cdi xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://openlcb.org/schema/cdi/1/1/cdi.xsd">

   to define the OpenLCB CDI version of the content.

   The schema contents are normative.

   Numerical values in attributes and element text shall be specified as decimal numbers. OpenLCB nodes are
   not required to be able to parse any other numeric format.

5.1 XML Elements

  5.1.1 <identification> Element

   The <identification> element, if present, specifies manufacturer-provided identification information
   about the node. This information is not user-editable. If this element is provided and the node also
   supports the OpenLCB Simple Node Information Protocol (SNIP), the contents of the SNIP Reply shall match
   the respective tags in the <identification> element. If this element is provided, and the node also
   provides the <acdi> element, the contents provided by the ACDI spaces shall match the respective tags in
   the <identification> element.

  5.1.2 <acdi> Element

   The <acdi> element, if specified without the attribute `fixed', or with the attribute `fixed=”4”' or
   higher, specifies that the following information is available for read:

    Space            Address            Size (bytes)            Type             Description                

    252              0                  1                       int              Version                    

    252              1                  41                      string           Manufacturer               

    252              42                 41                      string           Model                      

    252              83                 21                      string           Hardware version           

    252              104                21                      string           Software version           

   The value at the Version variable shall be the same as the value of the attribute `fixed'.

   The <acdi> element, if specified without the attribute `var', or with the attribute `var=”2”' or higher,
   specifies that the following information is available for read and write:

    Space          Address          Size (bytes)          Type            Description                       

    251            0                1                     int             Version                           

    251            1                63                    string          User-supplied name                

    251            64               64                    string          User-supplied description         

   The value at the Version variable shall be the same as the value of the attribute `var'.

   The <acdi> element shall be specified if and only if the Protocol Support Reply message carries the
   `ACDI' bit set. See the OpenLCB Message Network Standard for the Protocol Support Reply message.

   If the <acdi> element is specified, and the Node also supports the OpenLCB Simple Node Information
   Protocol (SNIP), then the information provided by the SNIP Reply shall match the respective values
   provided in the ACDI space.

   A node may, but is not required to, express the same configuration options as specific segments and Data
   Elements therein.

  5.1.3 <segment> Element

   A <segment> element defines the value of Space in the attribute `space', which shall apply to all Data
   Elements within, and the value of `origin', which shall be considered as the Address of a Data Element
   of size 0 (zero) at the beginning of the <segment>^3.

   A Configuration Tool may, but is not required to, perform visual separation of the contents of different
   segments by appropriate UI elements, such as tabs, boxes or horizontal bars.

   A <segment> element shall contain an optional user-readable name and optional description tags, and a
   sequence of zero or more Data Elements.

  5.1.4 Data Elements

   The following elements are considered Data Elements: <group>, <int>, <string>, <eventid>.

   The value of the address within the segment is accumulated during a depth-first traversal of the
   contents of the segment definition element.  Address is initialized with the value of the attribute
   `origin' on the <segment> element. Each time an offset attribute is encountered, the value of the
   address is incremented by the offset (which may be negative) before any other processing of the element
   is done.  If the element defines a variable, the variable is located at the current address, and the
   address is then incremented by the size of that variable before advancing to the next element. This is
   formalized as follows.

   For each Data Element the following values are defined:

     * Space, which is defined by the enclosing <segment> element.

     * Address, which is defined as the End Address of the previous Data Element plus the value of the
       attribute `offset' on the Data Element.

     * Size (in bytes)

     * End Address, which is defined as Address + Size, unless otherwise specified.

    5.1.4.1 <group> Element

   The <group> element allows logical grouping of Variables, providing common documentation for them, and
   making multiple copies of the contained Variables. CDI implementors may, but are not required to, use
   this feature to express configuration of repeated hardware or software components (such as multiple
   input ports, output ports etc).

   A <group> element shall contain an optional user-readable name, optional description and a sequence of
   zero or more Data Elements. This sequence is considered to contain a Data Element of size 0 (zero)
   before the specified Data Elements^3.

   If the `replication' attribute is present with the value of N, then the group shall be considered as if
   the entire sequence of Data Elements were repeated N times.

   The End Address of a <group> element is defined as the End Address of the last Data Element in the
   contained sequence (after replication). The Size of a <group> element is defined as the End Address
   minus the Address of the <group> element.

   Configuration Tools shall not render a <group> element with no child elements^4 on their UI.

    5.1.4.2 <int> Element

   The <int> element defines a Variable of integer value.

   The Size of the <int> element is defined as the value of the `size' attribute in bytes.

   The integer value shall be written to the bytes pointed to in big-endian byte order. All bytes shall be
   written. Values smaller than defined by the <min> or larger than defined by the <max> sub-element, if
   present, are invalid and shall not be written. If the <map> enumeration is present, then values not
   present in the list of <property> entries of the enumeration are invalid and shall not be written.

    5.1.4.3 <string> Element

   The <string> element defines a variable holding a UTF-8 string that is user-readable.

   The Size of the <string> element is defined as the value of the `size' attribute in bytes.

   The string value shall be written to the bytes pointed to, starting at the Address of the <string>
   element, with at least one trailing 0 (null) byte. When writing a shorter string, any unused bytes shall
   be set to 0 (null).

   If the <map> enumeration is present, then values not present in the list of <property> entries of the
   enumeration are invalid and shall not be written.

    5.1.4.4 <eventid> Element

   The <eventid> element defines a variable holding an 8-byte value representing an Event ID.

   The Size of the <eventid> element is defined as 8 bytes.

   The Event ID shall be written to the bytes pointed to in big-endian byte order (most significant byte
   first).

   If the <map> enumeration is present, then values not present in the list of <property> entries of the
   enumeration are invalid and shall not be written.

                                        6 Future Extension (Normative)

   Configuration Tools implementing a future version of this Standard must be able to process CDI content
   defined according to any earlier version of the Standard, including this version.

   Configuration Tools implementing major version 1 of this Standard may assume the following about future
   minor versions of this Standard:

     * No existing tags will change the interpretation or default value of the `offset' and `size'
       attribute, and accordingly the Address and Size value, the data type and encoding of the value in
       the memory space. The <group> tag will not change the interpretation of the `offset' attribute and
       `replication' attribute.

     * All unknown tags that occur within the element <segment> or <group> and have an attribute `size'
       shall be considered to be Data Elements with Address defined as the End Address of the previous Data
       Element plus the value of the `offset' attribute, and Size defined as the value of the `size'
       attribute in bytes. The `size' attribute of all future Data Elements shall be required.

   No assumptions may be made about major version 2 and up of this Standard.
