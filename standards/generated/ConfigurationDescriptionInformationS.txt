                                                     Configuration Description Information

                                                    Feb 7, 2013                        Preliminary          

                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   Minimal introductory material, only the stuff that's absolutely needed to understand the Standard.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Any limitations to the area of use of the Standard.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   Citations to other docs, as needed.

                               4 Stuff to be merged into the above (or the TN)

   The first byte is used to distinguish the coding.

   “<” (which is part of the XML “<?xml version='1.0'?>” definition): Uncoded characters

   UTF BOM: Various UniCode forms

   0x01 – tag for compressed. One format defined for total start string of 0x0101. (If you want to use
   another format, decompress on board)

   (can't use 0x00 as lead, since that's the end-of-string indication)

   The schema at prototypes/xml/schema (better location?) is really the normative thing, because that's
   what we check.

   But we add the <acdi> element to it, so the document isn't really complete; “Other protocols may add,
   but not remove, elements and attributes”? Remove constraints? How does extensibility work here?
