                                                                   OpenLCB Standard

                                                                 Memory Configuration

                                                       Feb 17, 2015                      Adopted            

                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This Standard defines a protocol for configuring OpenLCB nodes by directly accessing their configuration
   memory.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Intended to be used to configure self-contained nodes over their OpenLCB links.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   This Standard is in the context of the following OpenLCB Standards:

     * OpenLCB Configuration Description Information (CDI), which defines fixed information to allow a
       Configuration Tool (CT) to configure a node.

     * OpenLCB Datagram Transport Protocol, which defines the protocol for transporting 0-72 byte datagrams
       from node to node.

     * OpenLCB Message Network, which defines message interchange for OpenLCB, specifically how this
       protocol appears in the Protocol Support Reply message and Error Codes.

     * The OpenLCB Stream Transport Standard, which defines the protocol for transporting data from node to
       node.

                                        4 Message Formats (Normative)

   The tables below show available configuration message formats. All other formats are reserved. Note that
   Byte 6 is sometimes specified as optional. When Byte 6 is specified as optional, and not used, it is not
   present in the message, and the remaining bytes directly follow Byte 5 with no Byte 6 padding in
   between.

4.1 Address Space Size

   Configuration memory addresses are 32 bits. The addressable quantity is the byte. There are 256 unique
   address spaces, which are specified using an address space selectors. Address spaces may be wholly
   designated as read-only or write-only by the implementing node. An address space may not be partially
   designated as read-only or write-only.

4.2 Address Space Selection

   Of the 256 unique address spaces, those that follow are required to be implemented by any node that
   implements this Standard (these may or may not have content on a particular node); the following address
   space numbers can only be used for the specified purpose, and if the corresponding information is
   available, it must be accessible by these address space selectors (in addition to any others the
   designer might provide):

     * (space=0xFF, control bits=0b0000011) Configuration definition – A read-only space containing the
       Configuration Description Information for this node, if any.

     * (space=0xFE, control bits=0b00000010) All memory – This special space provides access to all memory
       in the device, where “all” is defined by the designer.

     * (space=0xFD, control bits=0b00000001) Configuration – A writable basic configuration space, with the
       structure of the 32-bit space defined by the designer.

   These three spaces, inclusive, can (but do not have to) be addressed without an extra byte in the
   datagram using control bits in the flag byte (byte 1). All others must be specified as a byte value in
   byte 6 of the datagram payload (see Section 4.3).

4.3 Generic Error Handling

   The Error Codes returned by failed operations, either in the Datagram Rejected message, or the Failed
   response datagrams, shall conform to the general Error Code specification as defined by the OpenLCB
   Message Network Standard.

   An unknown command in byte 1 shall return a datagram rejected reply. Nodes may, but are not required to
   use the with error code “Not implemented, subcommand unknown”. as defined in the OpenLCB Message Network
   Standardan error-code.

   Additionally, the following protocol specific enumerated error code extensions (logically or'd into bits
   0-3 of the base error code as defined in the OpenLCB Message Network Standard) are defined for use with
   commands that are supported and known to the node:

     * “Permanent error, invalid argument” | 0x0001 – Address space is not known.

     * “Permanent error, invalid argument” | 0x00021 – Out of bounds, the address space is valid, however
       the address within the space is not implemented.

     * “Permanent error, invalid argument” | 0x00032 – Write access to a read-only address space. – Read
       access to a write-only address space.3

     * 0x000

                                                       (optional)

             0x42 Space 0xFE                                           Upper bit reserved, must be ignored  
             0x43 Space 0xFF        

   In reply to the datagram containing a Read command, the receiving node shall set the Reply Pending bit
   in the Datagram Received OK message. The receiving node may, but is not required to, include a specific
   timeout interval in the Datagram Received OK message.

   If the interval is provided and has elapsed without a Read Reply message being returned, the node
   requesting the Read operation may, but is not required to, repeat the request.

   Attempts to read from an invalid location, either outside the available address range in a valid address
   space, or from an invalid address space, still require a returning a Read Reply datagram with a data
   length of zero.

            0x58 Space in byte 6                                     * optional zero-terminated message     
            0x59 Space 0xFD                                            string (0 – 63 bytes)                
            0x5A Space 0xFE       
            0x5B Space 0xFF       

   In general, a read reply may provide less than the requested data, but always at least one byte if it's
   a valid read. The maximum read request is 64 bytes when reading via datagrams. When reading via streams,
   any length up to 0xFF,FF,FF,FF (4GB-1) can be requested; a length of 0x0 means “read forever” or until
   the end of the address space.

   Reading at least one byte, but less than the requested amount, due to the length of the address space is
   not considered an error.

   If the full number of bytes cannot be read for any reason other than the size of the address space, or
   if no bytes can be read, the Read Reply shall have the Fail bit set and include an error code instead of
   the requested data.

4.6 Read Stream Command

    Byte 0   Byte 1                 Bytes 2-5          Byte 6         Remaining Bytes                       
                                                       (optional)                                           
                                                                      (in network order, top to bottom)     

    0x20     0x60 Space in byte 6   Starting Address   Address Space    * Read Count (4 bytes)              
             0x61 Space 0xFD                                                                                
             0x62 Space 0xFE                                            * Destination Stream ID (1 byte)    
             0x63 Space 0xFF        

   Very similar to a Read Command, except that a stream is created to carry the read information back to
   the requesting node. The stream must be established before the Read Reply datagram is sent, so that
   error codes can be returned via the Read Reply in the stream initialization fails.

   The Destination Stream ID provided must be used as the suggested Destination Stream ID in the subsequent
   OpenLCB Stream Transport protocol Stream Initiate Request.

            0x73 Space 0xFF       

            Failure status:                                          * Error Code (2 bytes)                 
                                                                                                            
            0x78 Space in byte 6                                     * optional zero-terminated message

            0x7A Space 0xFE       
            0x7BSpace 0xFF        

   The Destination Stream ID must match the Destination Stream ID used in both the Read Stream Command and
   the subsequent stream that was created as a result of the Read Stream Command. The Source Stream ID must
   match the Source Stream ID used in the the subsequent stream that was a result of the Read Stream
   Command. The Read Stream Reply shall be sent after the stream has been established, but before any data
   has been sent using the stream. When the stream successfully closes, after having read 1 or more bytes,
   the transaction is considered complete. If the stream closes with an error, this transaction is
   considered to be in error.

   Should an error occur prior to or during the establishment of the stream, the Read Stream Reply shall
   indicate a failure with the error code set appropriately.

4.8 Write Command

    Byte 0       Byte 1                     Byte 2-5           Byte 6              Remaining Bytes          
                                                               (optional)          

    0x20         0x00 Space in byte 6       Starting Address     Address Space       Data (1 – 64 bytes)

                 0x03 Space 0xFF            

   If the write operation can be done immediately and succeeds, only the Datagram Received OK message reply
   to the Write Command datagram is returned. The Reply Pending bit is not set in the Datagram Received OK
   reply.

   If the write operation takes time, or fails immediately, the Datagram Received OK message reply to the
   Write Command datagram shall carry the Reply Pending bit set. The receiving node may, but is not
   required to, include a specific timeout interval in the Datagram Received OK message. This is followed
   later by the receiving node sending a Write Reply datagram with either OK or Fail set. If Fail is set,
   the error code shall be included. The optional message string may be, but is not required to be,
   included.

   If a timeout interval was provided and has elapsed without a Write Reply message being returned, the
   node requesting the Write operation may, but is not required to, repeat the request.

            0x1A Space 0xFE       
            0x1B Space 0xFF       

   This message is sent in only if the Reply Pending bit in the Datagram OK message reply to a previous
   Write Command is set. If the write fails, a Failure Status reply is sent with the Error Code set
   appropriately.

4.10 Write Under Mask Command

    Byte 0      Byte 1                    Byte 2-5           Byte 6             Remainder                   
                                                             (optional)         

    0x20        0x08 Space in byte 6      Starting Address     Address Space     Data pairs (2-64 bytes)

                0x0B Space 0xFF           

   The data pairs are (Mask, Data) where each of Mask and Data are single bytes. Bits in Data where the
   corresponding bit in Mask is a 1 will be written to the memory location. Bits in memory where the
   corresponding bit in Mask is a 0 will be left unchanged. The first data pair refers to memory at the
   Starting Address. Each following data pair refers to a successive byte in memory.

   The Write Under Mask Command requires a response consistent with that of a standard Write Command
   whereby the Reply Pending bit in the Datagram OK reply determines if a subsequent Write Reply will
   occur.

   After sending this command, and receiving Datagram OK, an OpenLCB Stream Transport protocol Stream
   Initiate Request will be sent. The destination node is not required to accept the subsequent stream,
   however, once the Write Stream Command has received a Datagram OK reply, the destination node has
   committed itself to sending a Write Stream Reply with the appropriate success or failure with error
   code. If the Datagram OK reply has the Reply Pending bit set, it may use any timeout value (if provided)
   to wait for the Write Stream Reply. Any timeout shall be from the time of the last stream shutdown
   message and is provided for the receiving node to commit data to memory.

   The destination node may reject the operation immediately with a Datagram Rejected response and the
   error code set appropriately. In this case, no stream will be established, and a Write Stream Reply is
   not required or expected.

   The Destination Stream ID must match the Destination Stream ID used in both the Read Stream Command and
   the subsequent stream that was created as a result of the Read Stream Command. The Source Stream ID must
   match the Source Stream ID used in the the subsequent stream that was a result of the Read Stream
   Command. The Read Stream Reply shall be sent after the stream has been established, but before any data
   has been sent using the stream. When the stream successfully closes, after having read 1 or more bytes,
   the transaction is considered complete. If the stream closes with an error, this transaction is
   considered to be in error.

   Should an error occur prior to or during the establishment of the stream, the Read Stream Reply shall
   indicate a failure with the error code set appropriately.

     * Available operations mask (2 bytes, bit coded): Indicate which operations are available so the using
       software can know whether convenience operations (which are not possible on some hardware) are
       available.

          * 0x8000 Write under mask supported

          * 0x4000 Unaligned reads supported. If not set, reads have to start on an address with the low
            bits, as given by the data size, all zero. For example a 4-byte write must have the low two
            address bits zero.

          * 0x2000 Unaligned writes supported. If not set, reads have to start on an address with the low
            bits, as given by the data size, all zero. For example a 4-byte write must have the low two
            address bits zero.

          * 0x0800 Read from address space 0xFC available (this is the manufacturer part of Abbreviated
            CDI)

          * 0x0400 Read from address space 0xFB available (this is the user-entered part of Abbreviated
            CDI)

          * 0x0200 Write to address space 0xFB available (this is the user-entered part of Abbreviated CDI)

          * Others reserved, must be ignored on receipt and sent as zero.

     * Write lengths supported (One byte, bit coded): (provided for devices that can only write certain
       sizes to memory) (at least one bit must be set)

          * 0x80 1 byte write

          * 0x40 2 byte write

          * 0x20 4 byte writes

          * 0x10 64 byte writes (full datagram, but not 63 bytes or arbitrary length, just exactly 64)

          * 0x02 arbitrary writes of any length OK

          * 0x01 stream writes supported (stream support will identify buffer size)

          * Others reserved, must be ignored on receipt and sent as zero.

     * Highest Address Space (byte): Highest number space available. Not all up to that need be available,
       but sparse allocation will slow down the process as “Get Address Space Information” is needed to
       determine whether they are present.

     * Lowest Address spaces (byte): Lowest number space available. Note that spaces 0xFD, 0xFE and 0xFF
       are assumed to be included even if the low space ↔ high space range doesn't include them. (also
       0xFC, 0xFB of Abbreviated Default CDI if bits indicate they're available)

   A node that only has the high spaces could have Highest Address Space = 255, Lowest Address Space = 253
   or 251.

   A node that has additional low address spaces, e.g. to make more memory available with a 2839-bit
   address, could have Highest Address Space = 127, Lowest Address Space = 0 and leave the top spaces
   assumed.

          * Bit 0 – 0b0: writable, else if 0b1: read-only

     * Lowest Address (Bytes 8 - 11) – optional, omit if zero, as that will let reply fit in single CAN
       frame; if present, “non-zero lowest address” bit in prior byte must be 1.

     * Description (Bytes 12+, variable length) – optional null-terminated string giving the user-readable
       name of this space

4.17 Lock/Reserve Command

    Byte 0       Byte 1        Byte 2-7

   At the start of configuration, a configuring node sends a Lock message with its NodeID. If no node has
   locked this node, indicated by zero content in the lock memory, the incoming NodeID is placed in the
   lock memory. If a node has locked this node, the non-zero NodeID in the lock memory is not changed. In
   either case, the content of the lock memory is returned in the reply. This acts as a test and set
   operation, and informs the requesting node whether it successfully reserved the node. To release the
   node, repeat the lock operation with a zero Node ID. The lock memory is set to zero when the node is
   reset. Note that this is a voluntary protocol in the configuring nodes only; the node being configured
   does not change it's response to configuration operations when locked or unlocked.

    0x20         0x8C         Number requested (1-8, 3 bits); upper bits reserved and must be ignored       

   Nodes maintain a list of unique Event IDs for use in configuration. These are allocated based on the
   node's unique Node ID. This command allows a configuration tool to get new unique Event IDs from the
   node's pool, for example to interact with the Blue/Gold configuration process. Each request must provide
   a different Event ID, without repeat, even through node resets and factory resets.

   This command notifies the target node that the configuration update operation sequence has completed.
   Nodes do not have to require this operation, but receiving it must be permitted. Configuration tools
   should send it at the end of operations. Nodes may, but are not required to, reset after sending the
   reply to this message.

4.22 Reset/Reboot Command

    Byte 0       Byte 1

    Byte 0       Byte 1        Byte 2-7                                                                     

    0x20         0xAA                                            Node ID                                    

   “Reinitialize/Factory Reset” restores the node's configuration as if factory reset. Node ID shall carry
   the destination Node ID for redundancy.
