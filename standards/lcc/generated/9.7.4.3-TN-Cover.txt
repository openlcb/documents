                    Important Notices and Disclaimers Concerning NMRA Standards Documents

   The Standards (S), Recommended Practices (RP), Technical Note (TN) and Technical Information (TI)
   documents of the National Model Railroad Association (“NMRA Standards documents”) are made available for
   use subject to important notices and legal disclaimers. These notices and disclaimers, or a reference to
   this page, appear in all standards and may be found under the heading "Important Notices and Disclaimers
   Concerning NMRA Standards Documents."

   Notice and Disclaimer of Liability Concerning the Use of NMRA Standards Documents

   NMRA Standards documents are developed within the Standards and Conformance Department of the NMRA in
   association with certain Working Groups, members, and representatives of manufacturers and sellers. NMRA
   develops its standards through a consensus development process, which brings together volunteers
   representing varied viewpoints and interests to achieve the final product. NMRA Standards documents are
   developed by volunteers with modeling, railroading, engineering, and industry-based expertise.
   Volunteers are not necessarily members of NMRA, and participate without compensation from NMRA.

   NMRA does not warrant or represent the accuracy or completeness of the material contained in NMRA
   Standards documents, and expressly disclaims all warranties (express, implied and statutory) not
   included in this or any other document relating to the standard or recommended practice, including, but
   not limited to, the warranties of: merchantability; fitness for a particular purpose; non-infringement;
   and quality, accuracy, effectiveness, currency, or completeness of material. In addition, NMRA disclaims
   any and all conditions relating to results and workmanlike effort. In addition, NMRA does not warrant or
   represent that the use of the material contained in NMRA Standards documents is free from patent
   infringement. NMRA Standards documents are supplied “AS IS” and “WITH ALL FAULTS.”

   Use of NMRA Standards documents is wholly voluntary. The existence of an NMRA Standard or Recommended
   Practice does not imply that there are no other ways to produce, test, measure, purchase, market, or
   provide other goods and services related to the scope of the NMRA Standards documents. Furthermore, the
   viewpoint expressed at the time that NMRA approves or issues a Standard or Recommended Practice is
   subject to change brought about through developments in the state of the art and comments received from
   users of NMRA Standards documents.

   In publishing and making its standards available, NMRA is not suggesting or rendering professional or
   other services for, or on behalf of, any person or entity, nor is NMRA undertaking to perform any duty
   owed by any other person or entity to another. Any person utilizing any NMRA Standards document, should
   rely upon their own independent judgment in the exercise of reasonable care in any given circumstances
   or, as appropriate, seek the advice of a competent professional in determining the appropriateness of a
   given NMRA Standards documents.

   IN NO EVENT SHALL NMRA BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: THE NEED TO PROCURE SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES;
   LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,
   WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
   OUT OF THE PUBLICATION, USE OF, OR RELIANCE UPON ANY STANDARD OR RECOMMENDED PRACTICE, EVEN IF ADVISED
   OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGE WAS FORESEEABLE.

    

   Translations

   NMRA’s development of NMRA Standards documents involves the review of documents in English only. In the
   event that an NMRA Standards document is translated, only the English version published by NMRA is the
   approved NMRA Standards document.

   Official Statements

   A statement, written or oral, that is not processed in accordance with NMRA policies for distribution of
   NMRA communications, or approved by the Board of Directors, an officer or committee chairperson, shall
   not be considered or inferred to be the official position of NMRA or any of its committees and shall not
   be considered to be, nor be relied upon as, a formal position of NMRA.

   Comments on Standards

   Comments for revision of NMRA Standards documents are welcome from any interested party, regardless of
   membership. However, NMRA does not provide interpretations, consulting information, or advice pertaining
   to NMRA Standards documents.

   Suggestions for changes in documents should be in the form of a proposed change of text, together with
   appropriate supporting comments. Since NMRA standards represent a consensus of concerned interests, it
   is important that any responses to comments and questions also receive the concurrence of a balance of
   interests. For this reason, NMRA, its departments, Working Groups or committees cannot provide an
   instant response to comments, or questions except in those cases where the matter has previously been
   addressed. For the same reason, NMRA does not respond to interpretation requests. Any person who would
   like to participate in evaluating comments or in revisions to NMRA Standards documents may request
   participation in the relevant NMRA working group.

   Laws & Regulations

   Users of NMRA Standards documents should consult all applicable laws and regulations. Compliance with
   the provisions of any NMRA Standards document does not constitute compliance to any applicable
   regulatory requirements. Implementers of the standard are responsible for observing or referring to the
   applicable regulatory requirements. NMRA does not, by the publication of NMRA Standards documents,
   intend to urge action that is not in compliance with applicable laws, and NMRA Standards documents may
   not be construed as doing so.

   Copyrights

   NMRA Standards documents are copyrighted by NMRA under US and international copyright laws. They are
   made available by NMRA and are adopted for a wide variety of both public and private uses. These include
   both use, by reference, in laws and regulations, and use in private self-regulation, standardization,
   and the promotion of modeling, structural and engineering practices and methods. By making NMRA
   Standards documents available for use and adoption by public authorities and private users, NMRA does
   not waive any rights in copyright to the NMRA Standards documents.

   IMPORTANT NOTICE

   NMRA Standards documents do not guarantee or ensure safety, security, health, or environmental
   protection, or ensure against interference with or from other systems, devices or networks. NMRA
   Standards documents development activities consider research and information presented to the standards
   development group in developing any safety recommendations. Other information about safety practices,
   changes in technology or technology implementation, or impact by peripheral systems also may be
   pertinent to safety considerations during implementation of the standard. Implementers and users of NMRA
   Standards documents are responsible for determining and complying with all appropriate safety, security,
   environmental, health, and interference protection practices and all applicable laws and regulations.
