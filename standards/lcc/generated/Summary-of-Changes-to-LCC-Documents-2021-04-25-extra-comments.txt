   Summary of Changes to LCC Documents 2021-04-25

  Documents with only Coversheet and CC License changes

   The changes to the first set of documents have effectively “no change to any standards content”, the
   changes are just to the Licensing details in the footer and changes to the NMRA cover sheet to include
   the logo with the ® symbol, add TM symbol to the LCC text and adds the legal fine-print.  Should be fine
   to adopt immediately.

          * Added the NMRA Legal Disclaimer fine-print

          * Changed the OpenLCB license to “Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International”

  Documents that have been Adopted after Public Comment

   These two documents were in draft since Feb-2016 but as they were the only docs in-progress at the time
   they got delayed. The protocol is in use already by manufacturers and supported in JMRI and hasn’t
   generated any issues we know about. Should be fine to adopt immediately.

  Documents with Changes for Public Comment

   The changes in two docs below correct an oversight in how we assign a 24-bit address range to
   Manufacturers without a DC Manufacturer ID. We would have had to allocate them a range in the DIY area
   which seemed the wrong “status” association. This change puts them right next to Manufacturers WITH a
   DCC Manufacturer ID. The other changes were fixing typos. Should be fine to adopt immediately.

   S-9.7.0.3-UniqueIdentifiers-2021-04-25.pdf

   TN-9.7.0.3-UniqueIdentifiers-2021-04-25.pdf

     *    * Added to section 5.4 Manufacturer Specific for manufacturers without a NMRA Assigned DCC
            Manufacturer ID

          * Corrected comments in 5.7 Specifically Assigned by Request for 16-bit and 24-bit allocations

    

   The changes in the next two docs add Well-Known Event definitions for two things. 1) Notify the
   occurrences of Power Brown-Outs onto the LCC Bus. 2) Adds support for interoperability of LCC and DCC
   Accessory Decoder (Turnouts + Signals) States. These changes have also been around for a long time
   (several years) and have been implemented already – they were simply delayed in processing and should be
   fine to adopt immediately.

   S-9.7.0.4-EventIdentifiers-2021-04-25.pdf

     *    * In section 5.2 Well-Known Automatically-Routed added:

               * Power supply brownout detected below minimum required by node

               * Power supply brownout detected below minimum required by standard

          * In section 5.3 Well-Known added:

               * Activate basic DCC accessory decoder address

               * Deactivate basic DCC accessory decoder address

               * Send aspect to extended DCC accessory decoder address

   TN-9.7.0.4-EventIdentifiers-2021-04-25.pdf

     *    * Add section 2.5.2.3 Power Supply Brownout Detected

          * Add section 2.5.3.3 Basic DCC Accessory Decoder

          * Add section 2.5.3.4 Advanced DCC Accessory Decoder

    

   The changes in the next two docs simply fix typos to reflect reality and should be fine to adopt
   immediately.

   TN-9.7.3-MessageNetwork-2021-04-25.pdf

     *    * Corrected example where message length was incorrectly displayed in section 2.3.5.1 Reject
            Addressed Optional Interaction, lines 271 - 273

   S-9.7.4.1-ConfigurationDescriptionInformation-2021-04-25.pdf

     *    * Corrected definition of Newline delimiter (0x0A) in section 5 Format (Normative) on line 41

  New Documents for Public Comment

   The next two docs have also been around for some years but needed to be “finished” when LogicRail
   Technologies approached us wanting to produce a LCC Fast Clock. There were minor changes (typos and
   readability) in 7-Mar-2021, but the previous changes were Sep-2018. Prototypes have been made and are
   working fine so these too should be fine to adopt immediately, even though they are new to the public.
