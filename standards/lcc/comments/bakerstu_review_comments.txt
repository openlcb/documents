  16  minor   "Other nodes which ... other nodes for interaction" could be

  63  minor   The internal document link text style seems unnatural to me.
              I suggest we apply no special formatting to these links.  I also
              recommend removing the "#" symbol, also seems unnatural
  73  minor   The internal decument link text style seems unnatural to me...

  97  minor   This is very clear to me, but it may not be verbose enough for
              someone who does not have 2+ years of familiarity with OpenLCB.
              In particular, maybe elaborate on the 0x04 value = number of
              null terminated strings.  We say that it will "double" as a
              count, but it need to be clear that the count is the prefered
              method and the 0x01 is maintained only for historical reasons
 113  minor   should we state that not using the framing bits for future nodes
              is deprecated and that all future nodes should use the framing
              bits?

      major   improperly named, should be "CommonInformationTN.odt not

  23  minor   "internet" should begin with a capital "I"
  25  minor   This is not consistently true.  For example, in the
              UniqueIdentifiers and UniqueEvents, byte 1 is the first byte.  I
              suggest adding "unless otherwise specified..." as we do specify
              this in detail in both Unique* docs.
  82  MAJOR   most (maybe all) of the standards docs (including EventTransportS
              and DatagramTransportS) do not follow this table format and are
              not even consistent with one another.  We need to resolve this!!!
  96  MAJOR   same as previous comment!!!

      MAJOR   tables (both general and CAN adaptation) do no not match
              CommonInformationTN format.
  29  minor   The first 1 to 7 bytes may actually contain the datagram type
              technically, it could be argued that this is not incorrect, as
              the first byte can be an "excape" character.  So perhaps this is
              okay.
  36  minor   change "0X01" to "0x01"
